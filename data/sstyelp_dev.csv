132	132	 As a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a Triumph , however , it is not .	2
133	133	 If director Michael Dowse only superficially understands his characters , he does n't hold them in contempt .	1
134	134	 If your taste runs to ` difficult ' films you absolutely ca n't miss it .	3
135	135	 ... a story we have n't seen on the big screen before , and it 's a story that we as Americans , and human beings , should know .	3
136	136	 Like Leon , it 's frustrating and still oddly likable .	3
137	137	 All in all , The Count of Monte Cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based .	2

146	146	 Even in its most tedious scenes , Russian Ark is mesmerizing .	3
147	147	 The continued good chemistry between Carmen and Juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained .	3
148	148	 Reggio 's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking .	3

157	157	 A study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers ...	3

164	164	 Thanks to Scott 's charismatic Roger and Eisenberg 's sweet nephew , Roger Dodger is one of the most compelling variations on In the Company of Men .	4
165	165	 Nine Queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head .	4
166	166	 It 's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of Anna Chancellor that makes this `` Two Weddings and a Funeral '' fun .	4

173	173	 Affleck and Jackson are good sparring partners .	3

224	224	 It seems like I have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now I ca n't wait for the sequel .	3
225	225	 It 's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant .	1
226	226	 An operatic , sprawling picture that 's entertainingly acted , magnificently shot and gripping enough to sustain most of its 170-minute length .	3
227	227	 The far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past .	3
228	228	 It inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental ` picture shows . '	4
229	229	 Awesome creatures , breathtaking scenery , and epic battle scenes add up to another ` spectacular spectacle . '	4
230	230	 By candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , -LRB- Jones -RRB- calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity .	3
231	231	 It 's unnerving to see Recoing 's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment .	2
232	232	 Good film , but very glum .	3
233	233	 Much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , Haneke has a different objective in mind -- namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation .	2
234	234	 Dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , The Piano Teacher is a film that defies categorisation .	4
235	235	 It haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away .	4
236	236	 Ah yes , and then there 's the music ...	2
237	237	 It has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience .	3
238	238	 Although Jackson is doubtless reserving the darkest hours for The Return of the King , we long for a greater sense of urgency in the here and now of The Two Towers .	2
239	239	 It is great summer fun to watch Arnold and his buddy Gerald bounce off a quirky cast of characters .	3
240	240	 Bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves .	3
241	241	 It will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth .	2
242	242	 This flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get .	4
243	243	 `` The Ring '' is pretty much an English-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws .	2
244	244	 The Wild Thornberrys Movie is a jolly surprise .	3
245	245	 Griffiths proves she 's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession .	4
246	246	 Prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , Jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment .	2
247	247	 Offers much to enjoy ... and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends .	3
248	248	 An important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values .	4
249	249	 Is this love or is it masochism ?	2
250	250	 Binoche makes it interesting trying to find out .	4
251	251	 The mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted .	4
252	252	 Worth watching for Dong Jie 's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change .	3
253	253	 Two hours fly by -- opera 's a pleasure when you do n't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated .	4
254	254	 It 's one heck of a character study -- not of Hearst or Davies but of the unique relationship between them .	3
255	255	 Candid Camera on methamphetamines .	2
256	256	 A subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; The Pianist does not .	1
257	257	 Equilibrium is what George Orwell might have imagined had today 's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 .	2
258	258	 Creepy , authentic and dark .	2
259	259	 This disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget .	2
260	260	 Martin and Barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by Sven Wollter and Viveka Seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid .	4
261	261	 A twisty , moody slice of Southern Gothic ...	2
262	262	 It 's so good that you can practically see the Hollywood ` suits ' trying to put together the cast and filmmaking team for the all-too - inevitable American remake .	2
263	263	 The weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough .	3
264	264	 An absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss .	1
265	265	 ` They ' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying I 'm still stunned .	2
266	266	 And I 've decided to leave a light on every night from now on .	2
267	267	 This tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , Nicholas Meyer 's Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country .	3
268	268	 ... with `` The Bourne Identity '' we return to the more traditional action genre .	3
269	269	 Beneath Clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from Rabbit-Proof Fence .	2
270	270	 The film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games Japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it 's an enjoyable one .	2
271	271	 Holm ... embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma .	4
272	272	 It is amusing , and that 's all it needs to be .	4
273	273	 Among the year 's most intriguing explorations of alientation .	4
274	274	 A full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution .	3
275	275	 Seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work .	4
276	276	 Audrey Tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm , and in this literate French comedy , she 's as morning-glory exuberant as she was in Amélie .	3
277	277	 The movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate\/surf culture , the L.A. beach scene and the imaginative -LRB- and sometimes illegal -RRB- ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults .	4
278	278	 Even if you do n't think -LRB- Kissinger 's -RRB- any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he 'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch .	3
279	279	 The story and structure are well-honed .	3
280	280	 Fresnadillo 's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that wo n't go away .	3
281	281	 It 's made with deftly unsettling genre flair .	3
282	282	 It just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read Stevenson 's book , which is a treasure in and of itself .	3
283	283	 Funny but perilously slight .	3
284	284	 Overall very good for what it 's trying to do .	3
285	285	 Forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of Friday-night excitement and Milla power .	2
286	286	 Ramsay , as in Ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid .	3
287	287	 It may seem long at 110 minutes if you 're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert .	2
288	288	 A lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s European-set spy pictures .	4
289	289	 It proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study .	3
290	290	 The Son 's Room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos .	3
291	291	 Morton uses her face and her body language to bring us Morvern 's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan .	3
292	292	 The film may appear naked in its narrative form ... but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the Catholic doctrine	3
293	293	 A superbly acted and funny\/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate .	3
294	294	 One of the smartest takes on singles culture I 've seen in a long time .	4
295	295	 There is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them .	3
296	296	 CQ 's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best European directors .	3
297	297	 The emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who 's ever had family trauma .	3
298	298	 Holy mad maniac in a mask , Splat-Man !	2
299	299	 Good old-fashioned slash-and-hack is back !	3
300	300	 As unseemly as its title suggests .	3
301	301	 The French are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the Americans , who have a passion for Musketeers , only to spoof them .	2
302	302	 The fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural French school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work .	3
303	303	 It 's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part .	3
304	304	 Allows us to hope that Nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker .	3
305	305	 Maneuvers skillfully through the plot 's hot brine -- until it 's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors .	2
306	306	 It has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness .	2
307	307	 Anchored by Friel and Williams 's exceptional performances , the film 's power lies in its complexity .	4
308	308	 Nothing is black and white .	2
309	309	 It 's a charming and often affecting journey .	4
310	310	 No screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of Clones ' last 45 minutes .	4
311	311	 A poignant and compelling story about relationships , Food of Love takes us on a bumpy but satisfying journey of the heart .	4
312	312	 The Chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between Gauls and Yanks .	3
313	313	 Not since Tom Cruise in Risky Business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear .	3
314	314	 Aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better .	3
315	315	 Uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance .	4
316	316	 It confirms Fincher 's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight .	4

318	318	 A marvel like none you 've seen .	3
319	319	 With tightly organized efficiency , numerous flashbacks and a constant edge of tension , Miller 's film is one of 2002 's involvingly adult surprises .	3
320	320	 Mr. Tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and What Time Is It There ?	4
321	321	 should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor .	2
322	322	 Writer\/director Mark Romanek spotlights the underlying caste system in America .	2
323	323	 It 's a scathing portrayal .	2
324	324	 This is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults .	4
325	325	 The characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory .	4
326	326	 The film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens .	3
327	327	 Moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not .	3
328	328	 Not a film to rival To Live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted .	2

332	332	 What Time Is It There ?	2

334	334	 It haunts you , you ca n't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it .	3
335	335	 if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then Esther 's story is a compelling quest for truth .	3

342	342	 But it 's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle .	0

345	345	 ` Easily my choice for one of the year 's best films . '	4
346	346	 Charles ' entertaining film chronicles Seinfeld 's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic Adams ' attempts to get his shot at the big time .	3
347	347	 That dogged good will of the parents and ` vain ' Jia 's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums .	3
348	348	 The movie is for fans who ca n't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it .	2
349	349	 The volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-Hollywood that it seems positively French in its rhythms and resonance .	3
350	350	 A densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among Jean-Luc Godard 's finest work .	4
351	351	 Michael Gerbosi 's script is economically packed with telling scenes .	4
352	352	 A strangely compelling and brilliantly acted psychological drama .	4

354	354	 Open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny .	2
355	355	 Bennett 's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any ` reality ' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch Some Body first .	4

357	357	 The film is powerful , accessible and funny .	4

361	361	 It 's like watching a nightmare made flesh .	0
362	362	 It is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of Leon 's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction .	2

367	367	 -LRB- Majidi -RRB- makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day .	2
368	368	 Though only 60 minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions .	3

370	370	 Immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop DJs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch .	3
371	371	 Further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of Dubya 's Axis of Evil .	3
372	372	 There 's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache .	3
373	373	 A simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past .	4
374	374	 Lovely and poignant .	4
375	375	 Puts a human face on a land most Westerners are unfamiliar with .	3
376	376	 I ca n't say that I liked Homeboy ; it 'd be more accurate to say that I found it intriguing , bizarre , Dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way .	2
377	377	 Displaying about equal amounts of naiveté , passion and talent , Beneath Clouds establishes Sen as a filmmaker of considerable potential .	3
378	378	 The vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together .	3
379	379	 Not since Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa 's Ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur .	4

381	381	 If the first Men in Black was money , the second is small change .	0
382	382	 But it still jingles in the pocket .	3
383	383	 It 's fun lite .	3
384	384	 Passable entertainment , but it 's the kind of motion picture that wo n't make much of a splash when it 's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards .	1
385	385	 I just loved every minute of this film .	4
386	386	 This is a winning ensemble comedy that shows Canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world .	4
387	387	 Just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever .	3
388	388	 My Wife Is an Actress is an utterly charming French comedy that feels so American in sensibility and style it 's virtually its own Hollywood remake .	4
389	389	 It will grip even viewers who are n't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of American society in an unnerving way .	3
390	390	 A muckraking job , the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment , and a fairly effective one at that .	2
391	391	 A tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty .	4
392	392	 Belongs to Daniel Day-Lewis as much as it belongs to Martin Scorsese ; it 's a memorable performance in a big , brassy , disturbing , unusual and highly successful film .	4
393	393	 An exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir , Minority Report twists the best of technology around a gripping story , delivering a riveting , pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order	4

396	396	 Pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins .	1
397	397	 If you 're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here .	3
398	398	 Few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands .	4
399	399	 Corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless .	3
400	400	 It 's the perfect kind of film to see when you do n't want to use your brain .	2
401	401	 At all .	2
402	402	 While it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century , and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets , it 's alarmingly current .	2
403	403	 Feature debuter D.J. Caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter Tony Gayton 's narcotics noir to life .	4

414	414	 More concerned with Sade 's ideas than with his actions .	2

416	416	 An entertaining , colorful , action-filled crime story with an intimate heart .	3
417	417	 While Undisputed is n't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes Mr. Hill higher than he 's been in a while .	3

430	430	 Escaping the studio , Piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie .	3
431	431	 Very psychoanalytical -- provocatively so -- and also refreshingly literary .	3
432	432	 A gorgeous , witty , seductive movie .	3
433	433	 The special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original , while the Oscar-winning sound and James Horner 's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system .	3
434	434	 On the heels of The Ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness .	3
435	435	 With Rabbit-Proof Fence , Noyce has tailored an epic tale into a lean , economical movie .	3
436	436	 -LRB- A -RRB- n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the Disney comedies from the 60s .	4
437	437	 Preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment .	4

443	443	 The draw -LRB- for `` Big Bad Love '' -RRB- is a solid performance by Arliss Howard .	4
444	444	 It gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect , and is engrossing and moving in its own right .	3
445	445	 The terrific and bewilderingly underrated Campbell Scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing .	4

449	449	 It wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor .	3
450	450	 Smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities .	2

460	460	 Kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble .	2
461	461	 The sort of film that makes me miss Hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there 's hope for popular cinema yet .	3
462	462	 First-time writer-director Serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving , effective little film .	3
463	463	 Atom Egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues	4
464	464	 essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of Aliens .	2
465	465	 ` De Niro ... is a veritable source of sincere passion that this Hollywood contrivance orbits around . '	4
466	466	 The whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film .	2
467	467	 While its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer 's appetite , the film 's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving .	3
468	468	 Hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people .	3
469	469	 Based on a devilishly witty script by Heather McGowan and Niels Mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters	4
470	470	 It 's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way .	1
471	471	 If you 've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like , here it is .	2
472	472	 Exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes .	3
473	473	 Whether writer-director Anne Fontaine 's film is a ghost story , an account of a nervous breakdown , a trip down memory lane , all three or none of the above , it is as seductive as it is haunting .	3
474	474	 What the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as Corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action .	3
475	475	 If you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you .	4
476	476	 The quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy .	3
477	477	 This film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities .	1
478	478	 Another one of those estrogen overdose movies like `` Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood , '' except that the writing , acting and character development are a lot better .	3
479	479	 A breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom , while offering exceptionally well-detailed characters .	4

493	493	 A good piece of work more often than not .	3
494	494	 The movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure .	4
495	495	 What distinguishes Time of Favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts .	3
496	496	 Smart , provocative and blisteringly funny .	3
497	497	 Nothing is sacred in this gut-buster .	1
498	498	 The movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it 's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge .	2
499	499	 A touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back .	2
500	500	 Filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels .	4
501	501	 So , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today 's New Delhi .	3
502	502	 If Steven Soderbergh 's ` Solaris ' is a failure it is a glorious failure .	4
503	503	 `` Mostly Martha '' is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see .	4
504	504	 It 's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it 's brilliant .	3
505	505	 A pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings , the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable .	3
506	506	 Featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great Daniel Auteuil , `` Sade '' covers the same period as Kaufmann 's `` Quills '' with more unsettlingly realistic results .	4
507	507	 A spellbinding African film about the modern condition of rootlessness , a state experienced by millions around the globe .	4
508	508	 It 's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman .	3

510	510	 A very well-made , funny and entertaining picture .	4
511	511	 A giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of Oscar-winners : Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn .	3
512	512	 Its maker , Steven Spielberg , has n't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping Indiana Jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray .	2
513	513	 Oscar Wilde 's masterpiece , The Importance of Being Earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century .	3
514	514	 It 's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even Oliver Parker 's movie adaptation .	3
515	515	 The movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life .	3
516	516	 Brilliantly explores the conflict between following one 's heart and following the demands of tradition .	4
517	517	 This remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise : Al Pacino loathing Robin Williams .	2
518	518	 The next generation of mob movie .	2
519	519	 Part low rent Godfather .	1
520	520	 Part Three Stooges .	2
521	521	 Lan Yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most American love stories look downright unfree .	2
522	522	 A thinly veiled look at different aspects of Chinese life clashing with each other .	2
523	523	 Light years \/ several warp speeds \/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful Insurrection .	3
524	524	 Which is n't to say that it 's the equal of some of its predecessors .	2
525	525	 If this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then The Grey Zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle .	2
526	526	 The Lion King was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on Imax it seems better , not just bigger .	3
527	527	 A gripping movie , played with performances that are all understated and touching .	4
528	528	 The piece plays as well as it does thanks in large measure to Anspaugh 's three lead actresses .	3
529	529	 The inspirational screenplay by Mike Rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end .	3
530	530	 Not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream American audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit .	4
531	531	 Director Andrew Niccol ... demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame .	3
532	532	 His healthy sense of satire is light and fun ...	3
533	533	 About a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it 's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological .	3
534	534	 This is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming .	3
535	535	 An artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre .	4
536	536	 Majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places .	3
537	537	 Richard Gere and Diane Lane put in fine performances as does French actor Oliver Martinez .	3
538	538	 The minor figures surrounding -LRB- Bobby -RRB- ... form a gritty urban mosaic .	3
539	539	 This is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you 're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other .	4
540	540	 It 's a demented kitsch mess -LRB- although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative -RRB- , but it 's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year .	3
541	541	 There is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine .	3
542	542	 All-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us .	3
543	543	 An interesting story with a pertinent -LRB- cinematically unique -RRB- message , told fairly well and scored to perfection , I found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive `` missing thing . ''	3
544	544	 A movie with a real anarchic flair .	3
545	545	 Without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a Kieslowski morality tale , Maelström is just another Winter Sleepers .	1
546	546	 Nicks , seemingly uncertain what 's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy .	1
547	547	 ` A ' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy .	2
548	548	 If there 's one thing this world needs less of , it 's movies about college that are written and directed by people who could n't pass an entrance exam .	0
549	549	 The script kicks in , and Mr. Hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow .	1
550	550	 -LRB- E -RRB- ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism .	1
551	551	 I am sorry that I was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy .	1
552	552	 No telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie .	1
553	553	 Looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen .	1
554	554	 In its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of Grease , without benefit of song .	0
555	555	 Indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie .	1
556	556	 It 's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it 's about as exciting as a sunburn .	1
557	557	 His comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level .	1
558	558	 Christina Ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire .	2
559	559	 At times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there 's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential .	1
560	560	 They should have called it Gutterball .	1
561	561	 Thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters .	3
562	562	 Mom and Dad can catch some quality naptime along the way .	2
563	563	 It 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .	1
564	564	 The best that can be said about the work here of Scottish director Ritchie ... is that he obviously does n't have his heart in it .	1
565	565	 Less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .	1
566	566	 Slick piece of cross-promotion .	3
567	567	 Taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes .	0
568	568	 It believes it 's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it 's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .	2
569	569	 It all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .	0
570	570	 Villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in Bibi 's generic angst -LRB- there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows -RRB- .	1
571	571	 -LRB- T -RRB- here 's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , Anne Rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them .	0
572	572	 It 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism .	1
573	573	 The techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are Chan and Hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we ca n't recommend anything but a rental for The Tuxedo .	2
574	574	 I got a headache watching this meaningless downer .	0
575	575	 Apart from dazzling cinematography , we 've seen just about everything in Blue Crush in one form or the other .	2
576	576	 Too much of the humor falls flat .	1
577	577	 Detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor .	1
578	578	 Van Wilder does n't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like Tomcats , Freddy Got Fingered , and Slackers .	2
579	579	 The piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .	1
580	580	 Very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant Achilles ' heel in `` Stuart Little 2 `` : There 's just no story , folks .	1
581	581	 The plot combines The Blues Brothers and Almost Famous -LRB- but with bears , and a G rating -RRB- , with an excruciating dollop of Disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure .	2
582	582	 No way I can believe this load of junk .	0

585	585	 There is no pleasure in watching a child suffer .	0
586	586	 Just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .	0
587	587	 The movie 's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach .	1
588	588	 But is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ?	2
589	589	 Even with a green Mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , Kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting .	1
590	590	 And that leaves a hole in the center of The Salton Sea .	1
591	591	 There 's just no currency in deriding James Bond for being a clichéd , doddering , misogynistic boy 's club .	2
592	592	 When the film ended , I felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .	0
593	593	 Full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny	2
594	594	 The film 's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .	0
595	595	 The Iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .	0
596	596	 It feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .	0
597	597	 This movie is maddening .	1
598	598	 It conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .	2
599	599	 Should have been someone else -	1
600	600	 The film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner .	1

608	608	 Velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the American filmmaking scene .	1
609	609	 Just one bad idea after another .	1
610	610	 Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` Swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling .	1
611	611	 Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .	1
612	612	 A movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .	2
613	613	 Corpus Collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .	1
614	614	 The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage American road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes	1
615	615	 It 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and Shiner , starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .	1
616	616	 A by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise .	1
617	617	 Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .	0
618	618	 Overall the film feels like a low-budget TV pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .	1
619	619	 It 's of the quality of a lesser Harrison Ford movie - Six Days , Seven Nights , maybe , or that dreadful Sabrina remake .	1
620	620	 It appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .	1
621	621	 Despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .	1
622	622	 An unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse .	0
623	623	 This movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .	0
624	624	 Hey Arnold !	2
625	625	 The Movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .	2

627	627	 Excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters .	1
628	628	 Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .	1
629	629	 A working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .	3
630	630	 If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .	1
631	631	 There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .	1
632	632	 It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster , Anne Meara , Eugene Levy , and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie .	0
633	633	 We have n't seen such hilarity since Say It Is n't So !	4
634	634	 Expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .	0
635	635	 The Cold Turkey would 've been a far better title .	1
636	636	 The idea of 49-year-old Roberto Benigni playing the wooden boy Pinocchio is scary enough .	2
637	637	 The reality of the new live-action Pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .	1
638	638	 The ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures .	2
639	639	 Zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .	1
640	640	 Try as I may , I ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` Thank you ! '	0

642	642	 While it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , Yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .	2
643	643	 It treats women like idiots .	0
644	644	 Though Catch Me If You Can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .	2
645	645	 Just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .	2
646	646	 A valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the NBA .	1
647	647	 Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .	1
648	648	 For starters , the story is just too slim .	1
649	649	 So much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .	3
650	650	 The experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .	0
651	651	 The film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , Southern California locations and star power .	2
652	652	 It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .	1
653	653	 Almost gags on its own gore .	0

667	667	 You really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .	0

670	670	 Well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .	0
671	671	 I thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as I slogged my way through Clockstoppers .	1
672	672	 While much of the cast has charm -- especially Allodi and Nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .	2
673	673	 This directorial debut from music video show-off Higuchinsky is all flash .	2
674	674	 Yes , Ballistic is silly .	2
675	675	 Unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .	0
676	676	 The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .	2
677	677	 The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .	1
678	678	 While it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records -LRB- Sugar Hill Gang , etc. -RRB- , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .	1
679	679	 Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .	0
680	680	 Care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of Fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .	1
681	681	 Forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .	1
682	682	 Does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past .	1
683	683	 K-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap Hollywood tension .	0
684	684	 Has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience 's awkward silence	2
685	685	 A ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .	2
686	686	 Whaley 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .	0
687	687	 Uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .	1
688	688	 The entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .	1
689	689	 The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .	0
690	690	 Confirms the nagging suspicion that Ethan Hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .	0
691	691	 Made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .	1
692	692	 It 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .	2
693	693	 Holden Caulfield did it better .	1
694	694	 A synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .	1
695	695	 Oh come on .	1
696	696	 Like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .	0
697	697	 If it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent .	2
698	698	 Simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .	2
699	699	 Not exactly the Bees Knees	1
700	700	 It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .	1
701	701	 The kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .	2
702	702	 Makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .	2
703	703	 The film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when Carvey 's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .	1
704	704	 Jacquot 's rendering of Puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .	2
705	705	 In his first stab at the form , Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .	2
706	706	 Chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .	1
707	707	 It 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .	0
708	708	 This is nothing but familiar territory .	2
709	709	 In execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , Killers From Space .	1
710	710	 One of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .	0
711	711	 A broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .	1
712	712	 Too slow , too long and too little happens .	1
713	713	 The film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .	0
714	714	 It 's just filler .	1
715	715	 Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .	1
716	716	 Utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , Roberto Benigni 's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .	1
717	717	 A hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the Mason-Dixon line .	1
718	718	 Scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .	0
719	719	 It 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .	1
720	720	 They takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .	2
721	721	 Barely gets off the ground .	2
722	722	 Even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , Miller 's hand often feels unsure .	1
723	723	 Pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director , Tony R. Abrams , in their feature debut .	1
724	724	 At its best , Queen is campy fun like the Vincent Price horror classics of the '60s .	3
725	725	 At its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .	0
726	726	 From the opening scenes , it 's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .	1
727	727	 It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .	0
728	728	 On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura 's best work since the XFL .	2
729	729	 Despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected -LRB- even , at times , preposterous -RRB- turns , Love is just too , too precious in the end .	2
730	730	 A TV style murder mystery with a few big screen moments -LRB- including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether -RRB- .	1
731	731	 By getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .	1
732	732	 Too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .	0
733	733	 Dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .	2
734	734	 Manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .	1
735	735	 Do not see this film .	1
736	736	 Minority Report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .	3
737	737	 Delivers the same old same old , tarted up with Latin flava and turned out by Hollywood playas .	1
738	738	 If you believe any of this , I can make you a real deal on leftover Enron stock that will double in value a week from Friday .	1
739	739	 To call The Other Side of Heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .	1
740	740	 In exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if I 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .	0
741	741	 If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .	2
742	742	 I 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .	1
743	743	 Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .	2
744	744	 It 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication -LRB- and who knew they even had any ? -RRB- .	0
745	745	 While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .	1
746	746	 For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .	1
747	747	 To my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .	2
748	748	 What the director ca n't do is make either of Val Kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .	1
749	749	 In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .	1
750	750	 It 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .	0
751	751	 Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .	2
752	752	 ... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .	1
753	753	 It 's not that Kung Pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk 's impish augmentation .	1
754	754	 A very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .	0
755	755	 Not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .	0
756	756	 A science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .	0
757	757	 Once -LRB- Kim -RRB- begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard .	1
758	758	 The words , ` Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .	0
759	759	 What 's next : `` My Mother the Car ? ''	2
760	760	 All the amped-up Tony Hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that .	1
761	761	 A sequel that 's much too big for its britches .	1
762	762	 So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .	0
763	763	 What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .	1
764	764	 A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .	2
765	765	 For all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution .	1
766	766	 A coarse and stupid gross-out .	1
767	767	 a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .	1
768	768	 Does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .	1
769	769	 There 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .	2
770	770	 It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .	0
771	771	 The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .	2
772	772	 But the power of these -LRB- subjects -RRB- is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative .	0
773	773	 Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .	1
774	774	 Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .	1
775	775	 Paid In Full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from Brian De Palma 's Scarface .	0
776	776	 That 's a cheat .	1
777	777	 Harrison 's Flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .	3
778	778	 This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .	0
779	779	 A string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .	1
780	780	 The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .	1
781	781	 Basically a static series of semi-improvised -LRB- and semi-coherent -RRB- raps between the stars .	1
782	782	 Too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... The Isle defies an easy categorization .	1
783	783	 An unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer\/director John McKay can swallow .	2
784	784	 It 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .	3
785	785	 `` The Time Machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .	0
786	786	 It does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .	0
787	787	 ... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .	1
788	788	 A morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other .	2
789	789	 It 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` Can This Marriage Be Saved ? ''	2
790	790	 columns from Ladies Home Journal ...	2
791	791	 The film 's essentially over by the meet-cute .	2
792	792	 I 'm sure if you 're a Hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself ... Me , I did n't care for it .	2
793	793	 It 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .	3
794	794	 Socrates motions for hemlock .	2
795	795	 The script is n't very good ; not even someone as gifted as Hoffman -LRB- the actor -RRB- can make it work .	1
796	796	 Walter Hill 's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama Undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .	2
797	797	 It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .	1
798	798	 It 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .	2
799	799	 Although there are several truly jolting scares , there 's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at .	2
800	800	 I 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .	1
801	801	 Star Trek : Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before .	2
802	802	 Wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty .	0
803	803	 Like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .	2
804	804	 I do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do n't treat me like a fool .	1
805	805	 Its well of thorn and vinegar -LRB- and simple humanity -RRB- has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks .	1
806	806	 For all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , Lily Chou-Chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .	1
807	807	 Do n't be fooled by the impressive cast list - Eye See You is pure junk .	0
808	808	 Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .	0
809	809	 The documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .	2
810	810	 Plays like a volatile and overlong W magazine fashion spread .	1
811	811	 A better title , for all concerned , might be Swept Under the Rug .	1
812	812	 This movie seems to have been written using Mad-libs .	1
813	813	 There can be no other explanation .	2
814	814	 Hilariously inept and ridiculous .	3
815	815	 Vera 's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .	1
816	816	 -LRB- A -RRB- shapeless blob of desperate entertainment .	0
817	817	 Feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work .	1
818	818	 Given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing Soderbergh has ever done .	0
819	819	 a by-the-numbers patient\/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground	1
820	820	 A dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going .	1
821	821	 Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .	1
822	822	 Pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery .	2
823	823	 For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal .	3
824	824	 With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric the Entertainer as Perry 's boss , there is n't a redeeming moment here .	0
825	825	 It 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense .	1
826	826	 Movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction .	1
827	827	 -LRB- director -RRB- O'Fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .	0
828	828	 The intent is almost exactly the same -LRB- as The Full Monty -RRB- .	2
829	829	 All that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .	1
830	830	 No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise .	0
831	831	 Even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and Robert De Niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .	1
832	832	 There 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .	1
833	833	 It 's not without its pleasures , but I 'll stick with The Tune .	2
834	834	 Miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .	3
835	835	 Despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .	1
836	836	 More maudlin than sharp .	2
837	837	 This is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director Dario Argento -LRB- a producer here -RRB- , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .	3
838	838	 It 's slow -- very , very slow .	0
839	839	 It 's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie .	1
840	840	 That 's pure PR hype .	1
841	841	 Characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license Avary employs .	1
842	842	 Comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of The Bicycle Thief .	1
843	843	 Visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it .	1
844	844	 Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with Green 's half-hearted movie career .	0
845	845	 There seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there .	1
846	846	 If you 're a WWF fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I. , you 'll probably like Rollerball .	2
847	847	 I do n't think I laughed out loud once .	0
848	848	 And when you 're talking about a slapstick comedy , that 's a pretty big problem .	0
849	849	 It 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .	1
850	850	 Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?	0
851	851	 ... turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .	0
852	852	 The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .	0
853	853	 My reaction in a word : disappointment .	0
854	854	 His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .	0
855	855	 It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .	2
856	856	 Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .	1
857	857	 Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .	3
858	858	 Feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .	0
859	859	 For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .	1
860	860	 I 've always dreamed of attending Cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .	1
861	861	 The vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : Fatal Attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; Unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one .	2
862	862	 A workshop mentality prevails .	2
863	863	 It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .	0
864	864	 Yes , dull .	0
865	865	 Pumpkin wants to have it both ways .	2
866	866	 Director Uwe Boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .	1
867	867	 -LRB- W -RRB- hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , Jane Goodall 's Wild Chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands .	1
868	868	 Outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .	1
869	869	 This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .	0
870	870	 An occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story .	1
871	871	 A bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance ...	0
872	872	 It 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .	2
873	873	 As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even Ms. Redgrave 's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .	0
874	874	 New Best Friend 's Playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .	2
875	875	 The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .	1
876	876	 Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; Perdition , meanwhile , reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas .	2
877	877	 While the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .	2
878	878	 As the latest bid in the TV-to-movie franchise game , I Spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .	1
879	879	 This is n't even Madonna 's Swept Away .	1
880	880	 This is her Blue Lagoon .	2
881	881	 The director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .	1
882	882	 ... the film suffers from a lack of humor -LRB- something needed to balance out the violence -RRB- ...	1
883	883	 Burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .	1
884	884	 An overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .	1
885	885	 Has all the depth of a wading pool .	0
886	886	 This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .	1
887	887	 The so-inept - it 's - surreal dubbing -LRB- featuring the voices of Glenn Close , Regis Philbin and Breckin Meyer -RRB- brings back memories of cheesy old Godzilla flicks .	0
888	888	 ... the movie is just a plain old monster .	0
889	889	 If this disposable tissue has one wild card , it 's John Turturro , who 's simply fab as a Spanish butler with a foot fetish .	2
890	890	 One long string of cliches .	1
891	891	 Fancy a real downer ?	1
892	892	 -LRB- Leigh -RRB- lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race .	2
893	893	 Professionally speaking , it 's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .	0
894	894	 Nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .	0
895	895	 Weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger .	2
896	896	 But its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell .	2
897	897	 At once half-baked and overheated .	1
898	898	 There 's a solid woman - finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you 'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .	2
899	899	 I still ca n't relate to Stuart : He 's a mouse , for cryin ' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .	2
900	900	 -LRB- Serry -RRB- wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition .	3
901	901	 It 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .	1

905	905	 Exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids .	2
906	906	 Its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?	1
907	907	 The problem with this film is that it lacks focus .	1
908	908	 I sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .	1
909	909	 A momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year .	2
910	910	 ... think of it as American Pie On Valium .	2

912	912	 It 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .	0
913	913	 With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .	1
914	914	 Some of it is clever , but it is never melodic \/	2
915	915	 Better to just call it ABC Kiarostami .	2
916	916	 For AIDS and Africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .	2
917	917	 No aspirations to social import inform the movie version .	1
918	918	 This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .	0
919	919	 Manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious .	2
920	920	 This rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well .	2
921	921	 It 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .	1
922	922	 As vulgar as it is banal .	1
923	923	 You wonder why Enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .	1
924	924	 The film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .	1
925	925	 The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second .	1
926	926	 More whiny downer than corruscating commentary .	1
927	927	 Suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it 's been packaged and sold back to us by Hollywood .	0
928	928	 Coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit .	1

941	941	 It 's everything you do n't go to the movies for .	0
942	942	 Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter .	1

944	944	 For all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .	0

947	947	 It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .	1
948	948	 Due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality .	1
949	949	 ... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments .	0
950	950	 So devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like XXX and Collateral Damage seem like thoughtful treatises	0

954	954	 Works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .	1
955	955	 The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .	1
956	956	 Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .	0

959	959	 A great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .	0
960	960	 There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .	0
961	961	 The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned .	3
962	962	 Whereas last year 's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it .	2

966	966	 There is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .	1
967	967	 The tale of Tok -LRB- Andy Lau -RRB- , a sleek sociopath on the trail of O -LRB- Takashi Sorimachi -RRB- , the most legendary of Asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .	1
968	968	 Directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .	1

975	975	 While there 's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer	3

978	978	 There is very little dread or apprehension , and though I like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .	1
979	979	 If you 've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .	1

983	983	 Sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation .	0

985	985	 Every time you look , Sweet Home Alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .	1
986	986	 Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show .	0
987	987	 The overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .	1
988	988	 Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .	1
989	989	 A fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz .	3
990	990	 Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .	1
991	991	 To say this was done better in Wilder 's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .	1
992	992	 At the very least , if you do n't know anything about Derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave .	1
993	993	 The actors are appealing , but Elysian Fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental .	2
994	994	 As ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .	0
995	995	 The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .	0
996	996	 There 's no emotional pulse to Solaris .	1
997	997	 With an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , Soderbergh 's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .	2
998	998	 It ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy .	1
999	999	 Denis O'Neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .	2
1000	1000	 The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .	1
1001	1001	 One of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .	1
1002	1002	 Serving Sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .	1
1003	1003	 The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .	0
1004	1004	 With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .	1
1005	1005	 Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .	0
1006	1006	 A misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .	0
1007	1007	 Like the Chelsea 's denizens ... Burdette 's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .	2
1008	1008	 It 's basically an overlong episode of Tales from the Crypt .	2
1009	1009	 The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .	1
1010	1010	 Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .	1
1011	1011	 Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .	1
1012	1012	 I ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but I almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .	2
1013	1013	 Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort	1
1014	1014	 Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .	1
1015	1015	 Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .	3
1016	1016	 It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .	1
1017	1017	 On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .	0
1018	1018	 The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .	1
1019	1019	 Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .	1
1020	1020	 Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .	0
1021	1021	 The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .	1
1022	1022	 Although Huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , The Piano Teacher is anything but fun .	1
1023	1023	 It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .	1
1024	1024	 Bad .	1
1025	1025	 Very bad .	0
1026	1026	 Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .	0
1027	1027	 May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .	1
1028	1028	 If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this Imposter .	1
1029	1029	 Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .	1
1030	1030	 The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .	1
1031	1031	 Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is .	1
1032	1032	 The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .	0
1033	1033	 The messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated Old Testament tale of Jonah and the Whale .	2
1034	1034	 Determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult .	1
1035	1035	 Historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit .	2
1036	1036	 But this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .	1
1037	1037	 Long Time Dead ?	2
1038	1038	 Not nearly long enough .	2
1039	1039	 Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .	2
1040	1040	 A solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .	3
1041	1041	 There 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .	1
1042	1042	 The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .	1
1043	1043	 Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .	1
1044	1044	 Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .	1
1045	1045	 McConaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .	3
1046	1046	 An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes .	1
1047	1047	 Skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .	2
1048	1048	 Who needs love like this ?	2
1049	1049	 Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .	1
1050	1050	 Returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , Sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .	2
1051	1051	 Exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .	2
1052	1052	 Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .	0
1053	1053	 Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .	0
1054	1054	 It 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .	1
1055	1055	 Whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite , Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife\/colleague , Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .	2
1056	1056	 It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .	1
1057	1057	 A sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .	1
1058	1058	 Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .	0
1059	1059	 I 'm just too bored to care .	1
1060	1060	 Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .	1
1061	1061	 As befits its title , this PG-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the Snuggle Fabric Softener bear .	2
1062	1062	 Attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .	1
1063	1063	 It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .	0
1064	1064	 Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .	1
1065	1065	 Scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .	1
1066	1066	 A beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .	2
1067	1067	 Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?	0
1068	1068	 This is so bad .	0
1069	1069	 Even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping .	2
1070	1070	 I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by Rohmer , for example .	2
1071	1071	 Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .	1
1072	1072	 This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .	1
1073	1073	 The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .	1
1074	1074	 It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .	1
1075	1075	 The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .	0
1076	1076	 Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ` comedy gag . '	2
1077	1077	 At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .	1
1078	1078	 A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .	1
1079	1079	 The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .	1
1080	1080	 The end result is a film that 's neither .	1
1081	1081	 Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .	1
1082	1082	 Something like scrubbing the toilet .	1
1083	1083	 Or emptying rat traps .	1
1084	1084	 Or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife .	1
1085	1085	 Scooby Dooby Doo \/ And Shaggy too \/ You both look and sound great .	3
1086	1086	 \/ But Daphne , you 're too Buff \/ Fred thinks he 's tough \/ And Velma - wow , you 've lost weight !	1
1087	1087	 Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?	1
1088	1088	 There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .	1
1089	1089	 However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .	1
1090	1090	 The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .	0
1091	1091	 But it could have been worse .	1
1092	1092	 Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .	1
1093	1093	 Even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with Trouble Every Day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .	0
1094	1094	 comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special , freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class .	0
1095	1095	 ... Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` Crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .	1
1096	1096	 it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so	1
1097	1097	 It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .	1
1098	1098	 The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .	1
1099	1099	 Sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn .	2
1100	1100	 Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .	1
	1101	Muuuuuch better than Sbux. I really enjoy this place every time!	3
	1102	"Saint Francis of Assisi may be the patron saint of animals and the environment but after a recent visit, I wonder if St Francis neighborhood restaurant in Central Phoenix can live up to it's namesake.\n\nI'd heard several things about this little restaurant near Camelback road and Central in Phoenix via both Facebook and Twitter, mostly from people who seem to know a thing or two about a good meal. After having stopped in on several occasions I'm ready to share my thoughts.\n\nThe restaurant is larger than it appears from the outside, in fact, you can (and I have on many occasions) drive right past with nary a glance. The parking is terrible but once inside things begin to come together. The decor is modern, funky and comfortable, the staff accommodating, and the menu enticing.\n\nAs I'm a true fan of a good burger (something so simple yet often executed so poorly), I was drawn to the French onion burger with it's promise of applewood smoked bacon, gruyere cheese and crispy onions ($13).\n\nI've had quite a few \""gourmet\"" burgers in my time and have sadly discovered the only thing gourmet about many of them is the price tag. Having said this, I was a little dubious about what would arrive.\n\nMy (notably) pleasant server arrived with my meal in short order and I was quite pleased with both it's presentation and size, not obnoxiously large but certainly enough to justify the price if that were the only criteria.\n\nOn first bite I knew something was different about this burger, it was perfectly cooked mid-rare, juicy, and the thick, crunchy bacon played well with sweet, slightly salty gruyere cheese. Crispy onions seemed a great addition and added texture and flavor while the bun, and this is important, didn't go all soggy and fall apart.\n\nFlanked by some of the tastiest French fries I've had in a while, I'd have to give this burger high marks for concept (simple but well executed), texture (not the typical dry OR mushy patty passed off as gourmet), and taste (in this case, exactly what I'm looking for in a burger).\n\nIf you find yourself in need of sustenance on the long road to wherever it is you happen to be heading, make a point of stopping in and partaking in the food and hospitality of St. Francis."	2
	1103	The store is great. Easy to get in and out. The Take Care Clinic is nice as well. The people that work it are very nice. The reason this location got a 3 is because it is ALWAYS super busy.  Their is always a long line to pick up prescriptions, both inside and in the drive thru. Sometimes you have wait over 30 minutes just to pick up ready prescriptions.	2
	1104	Two items that you MUST ORDER:\n\n(1) Beef Rib Steak: Lindsay Ranch, OR, Washugyu/Angus 90/lb.\n(2) Robuchon (butter with potatoes -- SO MUCH BUTTER!)\n\nTIP: When you make reservations, make sure you don't get the communal table!	4
	1105	I like PT's but not this one .. Bartender didn't take care or give you any clue about the gaming discount for drink and they're charged  me all the drinks and food full price event I gambled. I should have free drinks Cus only 1 drink .. I pay for the hold bill food and drink with gambled with them .. When I asked he said nothing we can do with it lol thank you mr. Bartender ..	0
	1106	Fantastic.  I had 2 tacos, Waygu Brisket, and a Ribs.  Fantastic flavor and good value for the price	4
	1107	"I just don't get the reviews that are raving about this place.  Been here twice - once for dinner with my wife and kids, once for lunch with colleagues from work.\n\nDinner: Ok, we did get one of the semi-private rooms with a large table which is always nice with two kids that can be squirmy.  That was a positive.  But the server was a bit overbearing and pushy, trying to sell us this, that, and the other thing after we made it clear to her several times (I thought) that we just needed some time to look at the menus (yes, plural... and they're all huge).  We got a mixture of Chinese and Japanese.  It was all ok (not exceptional) and somehow the bill came to $90, which is crazy for what we got (yeah, I wasn't paying attention when we ordered, but based on what we ordered I would have expected ~$60).  Must have been the \""chef's special roll\"" the server talked us into, which was completely forgettable.\n\nLunch:  A bit of a mess.  Three of us got the sushi roll specials, one got hibachi chicken.  Failure #1 was service of the miso soup.  The bowls were plenty full, and the way the server gripped them when serving them, his thumb was in the soup.  Yuck.  Failure #2 was the hibachi chicken, which took at least 10 minutes to arrive after the rest of us were served lunch.  Failure #3 was when paying- their credit card machine was broken.  They wanted to write down our credit card info, which we did not want them to do.  They hassled us about writing a check-- C'mon, its YOUR credit card machine that broke!  That already hassles us-- so don't add to the hassles and just take the check!\n\nOverall-- the food is not bad (it's a pretty low bar for Asian food in this part of town), but there are substantially better Chinese and better Japanese places elsewhere."	1
	1108	This may be the best pizza I've ever had. And I've lived all over the country and world while in the military for 20 yrs.  It's in the ingredients. High quality, unique.  The pie is cooked just right.  Incredibly flavorful. \nI drive all the way from Sun Prairie once a week to get this pizza.  Amazing. \nGreat, friendly service as well.  \n\nP.s. Shocked that this place only has 3.5 stars on here.	4
	1109	We love this place! They are always busy, yet always get the order completely right. We have had the Thai chicken pizza, Gardein chick'n nuggets, & a multitude of different beers.  \nService is always excellent, whether you were at a table or in the bar area, and the hostess station is always very well manned.\nPrices are a little high, but the quality of what you get is worth it. We will be back again and again.	4
	1110	My fiance and I arrived roughly around 1020 and ended up leaving at 1105 without our order. No one bothered to check up on us and I was too pissed off after waiting more than 40 minutes to even dare ask. The car that arrived at 1055 got their order within 10 minutes and that's what pissed us off the most.  I have a feeling the kid never registered our order to begin with as it doesn't take 40 minutes to at least make a shake.	0
	1111	Wow.  Going a 2nd time a few weeks after the opening.  Talk about loss of credibility fo' shizzle!  The service really sucked big time.  Waited approx 15 minutes unti we could even wave someone down to order drinks.	1
	1112	"We stopped in because we happened to be in the area, although I wouldn't normally visit a development with the word \""Village\"" in it.  Of course I have a pretty hard time passing up $0.50 PBRs too.\n\nFist off the PBRs hit the spot, at that price I'm sure they're dispensing enough of it to maintain it at the peak of freshness.  We also had a few Moretti's for $1.50, another bargain but I don't think that's a daily deal.\n\nWe shared a little house/side salad.  For $5 I'm not sure I got a lot of value out of that.  Just a clump of greens on a plate.\n\nWe then split a 12\""  BBQ Chicken Pizza for $15.95.  That's probably the most I have ever paid for a pizza that size.  It was good but it certainly hasn't had me dreaming about it ever since.  I'd be just as happy with a frozen California Pizza Kitchen pie for $5.  Actually I'd be happier because then I'd have enough money for 22 more PBRs.\n\nNormally we would order a large pizza so we'd have something to take home, but only some pizzas are available in the large size.  This would lead one to believe that the pizzas are made ahead of time.  Who knows, but I think it's sort of a dumb way to set up the menu. \n\nWhat really caught my eye though was a parmesan chicken sandwich that I saw sitting on the counter, wow, that thing looked tasty!\n\nAtmosphere?  Not much going happening on a Sunday afternoon.  A few trust fund babies at the bar sort of made me hope that's not the normal crowd.\n\nIn summary I found the food to be okay but not worth the price.  Factor in the cost of the beers though and you'll come out even on the bill compared to most other places."	2
	1113	This is a review of their take-out service; I'm sure the experience is different in the restaurant itself. Also, I'm not entirely sure if the take-out menu has all the items that are in the in-house menu. I have never been to the restaurant itself. Decided to try the take-out menu because one of us was feeling sick and was not up to going to the casinos for a meal. We were staying at a timeshare near the strip that did not have room service.\n\nFirst, I tried ordering online because they have a convenient online ordering system through their website at kungfuplaza.com. The ordering system was very well organized, with pictures of the food you're ordering. However, after putting in my order, the final page indicated that the delivery address was my credit card's billing address which is in another state and not the hotel that I was staying in. I cancelled the order and called in the order instead. The woman who took the order had a strong accent, but she got my order right. The woman asked for spiciness level on a scale of 1 to 10, with one being really spicy. I was quite tickled by this method. Food arrived exactly an hour later as promised. There is a charge for delivery; I think it was six dollars or thereabouts. If paying by credit card over the phone, the delivery person will ask to see the credit card that you paid with along with a picture id. \n\nThe dishes were good; nothing spectacular, but sufficient for a take-out. The seafood tom yum had very little seafood but quite tasty. The roast pork noodle was okay. Pad Thai was quite good, and so was the beef larb. Portions were good, neither too little nor too much.  Thai iced-tea was delicious. The restaurant included Styrofoam bowls and plates, and plastic forks, knives, and spoons. They also did not skimp on the paper napkins, fortune cookies, and hot pepper sauce.  All in all, a good take-out experience and I would definitely order take out from them again. For the four dishes, drinks, a side-order of  steamed rice, and delivery charge, dinner was about fifty dollars.	2
	1114	One of my favorite places!\n\nI have a confession though... I'm a trivia addict.  So any restaurant or bar that has the Buzztime trivia automatically gets an extra start in my book... but for some reason this is where I like to play more than anywhere else.  I usually hang out in the bar/off track betting area, playing trivia and once in a while betting on the horses or dogs (with miserable results, I hate to add.)\n\nOne of my favorite sandwiches in the Valley is here - I love their Buffalo Chicken.  It's huge and covered in a pretty hot yet flavorful buffalo sauce. Unlike most places where it's not hot enough... oh and they let me choose the heat level.  Wings are really great here as well.\n\nNow I'm wanting to get back over there for a beer, buffalo chicken and gave of trivia... Too bad it's only Thursday.  \n\nCons: If you are a young single man looking to go out and meet someone, avoid this place at all costs. Also only a few microbrews, and not a lot of choice of beers on tap.	3
	1115	From my perspective, this place is as good as it gets.  No menu here, although I'm sure they already know based on available ingredients what will be prepared for the evening.  Instead, you select what you don't or can't eat from a list and then are surprised by what comes out.  While this is somewhat foreign to a dining experience, we had fun with it, learning in the process that 2 ingredients we thought we didn't like were actually delicious given the preparation.\n\nWe both selected 5 courses (you select from 4-7 I believe) and it was plenty of food.  Servings are small but almost all of ours were delicious.  I had 2 fish dishes and enjoyed both, but the highlight was a deconstructed key lime pie for dessert.  \n\nI'm not going to go on about ingredients in every dish and pretend to be the food critic I am not; rather, if you want a nice atmosphere, great service and outstanding food based on what you like and how you like things prepared, this place delivers.	4
	1116	I was disappointed. Started with the homemade chips with bleu cheese, descent taste, but chips should have been hot or at least warm. Had the Brunswick Stew, it was unlike any that I have ever had, and I don't mean that in a good way. If you are going to advertise a classic dish, serve it. This was merely a bowl of old meat and bean soup.\n\nThe shrimp and grits were actually quite good, nice flavor and consistency. The Jalapeno Cheddar cornbread arrived after all the other dishes and having to ask if it were coming. Don't bother, poor flavor, texture, and portion size, three strikes.\n\nService was prompt and friendly, atmosphere was nice but I will definitely not be returning.	1
	1117	"Rudest. Employees. EVER. \nWalked in with a cheerful hi how are y'all and was totally ignored, welcomed with a \""do you have something to sell\"" as if I didn't even matter, didn't even look in my direction. \nMANAGERS, read your reviews and get new employees!!!"	0
	1118	This is the second time Ive used Safelite. I am thrilled with customer service. The windshield was replaced and looks very good. The tech was very polite and professional. While replacing the windshield he dropped something on my hood and the clear-coat is gone in a two inch radius. I called Safelite and I heard a very sincere apology and an immediate effort to fix the problem. No questions, no hassles. Safelite is paying to have the hood of my truck fixed and providing me with a rental car while the work on my truck is being done. KUDOS to you Safelite. Thank you!! Thank you!!	4
	1119	Ok, this place is a toss up.  The hotel rooms are cheap, you can't stay at your local holiday inn for the price here.  With that being said this place is a great value for what you're paying.  The rooms are average, nothing special, same with the casino and buffet.  The location is greedy, easy walk to several casinos, fairly centrally located on the strip.  We left the casino during the day and only returned to the Monte Carlo to sleep.  They gave great customer service at the front desk, if you're gambling, DONT expect to get a drink.  The ONLY was we got any drinks here were walking up to the bar and playing the slots there, and we only got one after the bartender decided to come over and ask us if we wanted anything which took awhile.  But all in all this place is one of the best places to stay for the value!!!  It is not a bad hotel by any means.	2
	1120	Richard Pro here with another review.\n\nI enjoy coming to Flamingo for brunch. This is the only buffet on the strip with enormous windows, and the interior is very bright and welcoming. Ceilings are high, tables and booths are clean. Service is not fantastic--a bunch of tired old ladies serve you. \n\nAs breakfast goes, Flamingo is mediocre but it'll do the job. Prices here are lower compared to, say, Mandalay Bay or Bellagio.\n\n3 stars. If you want a breakfast buffet in Vegas that tastes okay and has a great view, I recommend Flamingo. I do make a stop here for brunch every year when I come to Vegas. Afterwards you can take a stroll out back to look at the flamingoes and the fish in a very natural and beautiful habitat. They used to have penguins too, an exhibit I would watch for hours.	2
	1121	Ok, so I know it is hard finding a decent place to eat that isn't an arm and a leg on the strip, but......this isn't that place. \n\nI had a living social voucher and I still left disappointed! The presentation of the food was cute; chinese stir fry came in a tipped over chinese food box. But the flavor was lacking big time, I didn't even get half way thru my dish and I don't play when it comes to food! \n\nWe also had a voucher for drinks, which also sucked! They  only let us choose from the frozen drinks that were basically just icees with a hint of rum. We didn't get buzzed, just stomach aches and brain freeze!! Go somewhere else!	1
	1122	A wonderful downtown restaurant. Although pretty small inside, the food has giant taste! The parking can be a bitch on Sunday morning but if you love close it's right off the light rail. They have this delicious salad, I believe it's called a Mediterranean or something of that nature. They also have a remarkable grill cheese with brie cheese and scrumptious apple wood bacon. YUM! And to top that off they have 3 dollar Mimosas. And on occasion you might catch News Channel 3's Ross Shimabuku there.........shhhhh	3
	1123	"I just called the Salon for the first time. The person who answered the phone was so rude. She yelled over me \""PLEASE HOLD\"" before I could even speak a word. I was on hold for five minutes. I called back. I was trying to get a price on color and she put me on hold three more times and cut me off anytime I tried to speak. I finally had to hang up because I couldn't take the rudeness.  This girl really needs to work on her customer service skills! Not a good representation for Aveda!"	0
	1124	I have been bringing my dry cleaning to Paris for years, 11 I think.  I have found them to be friendly and timely with service.  I like that they check my buttons and replace them without me having to ask, and spot clean stains when needed.  I drop my clothes off around 7 a.m. and pick them up the same day after work, about 5 p.m.  They have never lost or destroyed any of my clothes.	3
	1125	I got my pet's shots here and it was kind of a nightmare. The staff were really friendly and the people giving the shots were friendly, but the store was filthy and noisy. There was some sort of dog get together going on up front and there were dogs barking like cray the whoel time. It was very bad planning considering it was the same time that dogs, puppies, and KITTENS/CATS are going to be waiting around for a long time to get shots. I had my cat with me and he was terrified and the barking just continued. Plus I felt like my dog was just sitting in dirt the whole time because the floors were so disgusting. I probably won't return unless I need to get shots for my pets again.	1
	1126	Great Ambience, Decent Service, Overpriced Fake Italian Food.	1
	1127	It time to look for another seafood buffet, off-strip and a  non-casino restaurant. It is not that Rio Seafood Buffet is bad, nor it is good. I think for me, it lies in between mediocre. Crab legs are thinner than most buffets. Oyster is borderline frozen and very few and far between are 'pickable'. Salmon sashimi is cut in itty bitty portions though it still tastes great. Their sushi selection and taste were average. What I did like is their gelato selections for dessert. They were delicious and quite tastey.\n\nRio Seafood Buffet is more like a 3 stars. However, there is just a lot of good seafood buffets back in my area at almost half the price. Rio's high entry price really dragged it down to 2 stars.	1
	1128	"Second time staying at the HRH. Our \""non-smoking\"" room had the strongest smoke scent when we entered. The room never felt CLEAN, the entire stay I was never confident as to how clean the room/floors were. The TV remote didn't work and there were no controls on the actual TV. Housekeeping would come in after knocking ONCE. Both times it happened, I told the lady that we would be leaving in 10 minutes and asked her to come back later -- both times, never happened.\n\nI received an email about the $45 rate for the Wiz Khalifa concert. After changing my hotel accommodations to utilize this special, I was sorely disappointed upon check out and having $70 extra in \""resort fees and room revenue.\"" Ruined my entire experience. Truly...everything I have listed about the cleanliness of the room, etc. I was fine ignoring because EDC had just passed and I figured everyone was slammed with crazy guests and a lot of mess. But when I had to check out and found out the extra charges had occurred (and you're not even allowed to use the REFRIGERATOR for free! What is that?!), it definitely took all the little annoyances and made my stay regrettable. Won't be returning.\n\nI did give it an extra star because the pool was nice, free and not too crowded with some music in the background."	1
	1129	This is really more of a 2 star rating...but given there are not too many options in North Las Vegas....relative to the area and the options available, it gets 3 stars.  It's pretty much a glorified panda express menu with some Thai/Vietnamese offerings.  We tried the Vietnamese food....the grilled pork&shrimp, egg rolls, rice option and the similar vermicelli bowl option. The meat was rather dry and slightly on the salty side.  The egg rolls were quite mediocre and flavorless inside.  The noodles were cooked well....We also tried the fried chicken wing appetizer...and they were tasty but perhaps that was due to the excessive use of MSG as seasoning...none the less it was crispy goodness but I probably drank 3 glasses of water after the appetizer.  Will I come back?  Perhaps....there are just those days when I'm too lazy to drive....	2
	1130	My advice is go REALLY hungry.  The food is incredible and there are MANY different varieties of it.  I've eaten all three meals there, and you definitely get more bang for your buck at lunch.  It is expensive.  It's about $35 for lunch.  You'll pay more than that at most good restaurants in town and for much smaller portions.	3
	1131	excellent food\nlove me some grilleed cheese	3
	1132	Decent food. BIG portion sizes. Ok service, forgot to bring things that we asked for such as water.	2
	1133	We had a very memorable meal at Distrito,! After reading the other reviews, we were ready for the moderate serving sizes (we don't need huge piles of food). Our table was on the patio, and the warm evening sunset added to the relaxed feeling.\n \nThe hostess left both the happy hour menu, M-Th 5-7, with much cheaper prices! We ordered a hand made guacamole, the tuna ceviche, and four of the street tacos. The food is art, with the small tacos looking like beautiful pieces of sushi. The food was incredible in both presentation and taste.\n\nWe finished by sharing a delicious dessert. We were extremely happy with every aspect of this restaurant. If you want huge portions with cheap prices, go elsewhere. If you can appreciate truly innovative Mexican food, that will blow your mind, try Distrito!	4
	1134	"Apparently, the way to get in is to get bottle service... seems like every time I try to go clubbing I learn something new. I will teach you the things I've learned from previous Vegas trips:\n\n1) Dress nice. Duh, figured this out in college. Who knew?\n2) Wear single colored LEATHER shoes. Single colored sneakers don't count (again, college)\n3) Spend the money for entry fee. (The cheap clubs are NOT where the women are at)\n4) Don't be ugly. (See previous Vegas review about Tai club)\n5) Get there early before 9. (again, see previous review)\n6) Have a larger gaggle of sexy girls with you - for the guy:girl ratio. \n7) and now, get bottle service.\n\nIn an attempt truly do the \""Vegas club scene\"", I joined my friends in getting nicely dressed, complete with beautiful ladies in our group and was willing to pay the 50 dollar cover charge to get in.\n\nI figured that was covering most of the things I'd learned.\n\nWe stood in line for almost 2 hours, taking pictures, chatting, taking pictures, drinking the bottles that were filled with alcohol, waiting, taking pictures.. repeat ad nauseum.\n\nI'll say this. I FARKING HATE WAITING. Why couldn't they at least have waitresses taht serve you while you're in line? a bar within walking distance?! JEEZ. \n\nThe interior of the club was cool. I liked the waterfall, the lights were nice, the patio let in cool air, the A/C was strong and the furnishings were really swank. Service was decent, go-go dancers were smokin' hot and there was a performance by \""this-is-how-we-do-it\"" Montell Jordan (c: \n\nNice.\n\nHowever, if only they would have stopped repeating the same fucking music all night. We were there for 4 hours or so and heard quite a few songs more than 2-3 times. There has been probably 40 years of dance music that they could choose from, and they choose repeat the same songs? \n\nWTF?"	1
	1135	One of my favorate places to eat in Las Vegas! Awesome food and atmosphere.	3
	1136	Our Shiba Inu, Saki, loves this place. He looks forward to his twice a week visits to Doggie District so he can play with all his buddies. He is so tried when we pick him up at the end of the day that he sleeps the entire car ride home.  That alone makes it worth the money! Would recommend this place to anyone looking for supervised play time for their dog while they're at work. The staff is so nice and I feel completely comfortable leaving my pup in their care.	4
	1137	"I've been to a number of car washes in this town, and Lindstrom's is the finest. As a self-professed neat freak and perfectionist, I can assure you that your car will be well-groomed at Lindstrom's.\n\nThey are not in the habit of upselling and pressure tactics - just pressure washing. They are friendly, willing to accommodate my needs, and clean without frills. I have been coming to their car wash for some years, and continually come back (even when I stray, wash my own car or pick one of those gas station car washes on the fly). \n\nLindstrom's seems a little sad these days, and emptied. Not sure if it has to do with the recession, the brutally hot Phoenix summer or the recent raid on their service staff by the Sheriff's office for \""identity theft\"". But, whatever the case, Lindstrom's provides a superior service, and is a local business, and for those two reasons alone, please frequent this establishment. Your car will thank you."	4
	1138	This place is exactly 1.1 miles away from my house, and they refuse to bend the apparently stringent delivery rules. Subs so fast you'll freak, my ass.	0
	1139	Worst pharmacy service ever! Messed up my prescription several times this year already.	0
	1140	I have to admit that the food is really good but I can't get past the cost ratio.  2 people at $600 plus is just to much to validate the experience.  Its the perfect choice when someone else is buying!	2
	1141	Having a bit of a wander around Edinburgh and looking for something just a little lighter than standard fare for this city.  We tried this funky little place and really enjoyed our lunch.  Great service and a nice decor.  Try the spinach, goat cheese, and sweet potato pie.	3
	1142	Decent selection of flavors and toppings.  No sugar free options though which I've found are nice at other yogurt shops.  I tried a myriad of flavors, including the original tart.  The original tart was more creamy than tart, but I did enjoy the other flavors I had more, such as the refreshing mango sorbet, and the strawberry cream.  They have fresh mochi, popping boba, as well as the usual selections of candies and fruits.	2
	1143	**Late Review**\n\nI stayed at Vdara back in December with my Travel Buddy. We stayed in the Vdara Suite (which ended up being the handicap room) and we loved it! One bedroom with a huge bathroom and a comfortable king bed! Nice living room with a pull out couch. Another bathroom which was handy when it was time to get ready. The kitchen was nice even though we rarely used it (only the fridge to store our liquor he he he). \n\nVdara is off the strip but easy access through the City Center tram and connected by a tunnel to the Bellagio.\n\nI would definitely stay here again, the room was nice and comfortable. BUT I don't recommend staying here when it's cold in Vegas. The walk of shame in the freezing cold back to this hotel is no fun! Especially if you get lost on your way back to the room (only happened one time...I think lol)	3
	1144	Tank topped hipsters. \n\nBeer. Deli sandwiches. Vegan/vegetarian food. Jesus action figures. \n\nApathetic and mediocre. A familiar old friend.	2
	1145	mmm-mmm-mmm, I'm ambivalent about this bar...\n\nOn the plus side, we ate here after escaping a shady time-share sales pitch down the hall. We were so happy about getting out of there with our wallets intact that we were giddy to eat here. The bartender said that most of his customers came in straight from the timeshare pitch to get hammered and complain about being suckers.\n\nOn the minus side, the food is for suckers. It's overpriced, although a Total Rewards card knocks off a dollar or two, and it's not that good.\n\nOn the plus side, the mason-jar sized drink got my wife drunk enough to be very entertaining, but not so drunk that she hit the point of diminishing returns. So the bartender gets props for hitting the sweet spot.	2
	1146	Staff:  Always have great service when we go here.  Dunno if he's one of the managers and I can't ever remember his name, but he takes really good care of us as do the waitresses.  They have industry discounts too!\n\nGoods:  I'm a beer gal, so I wish they had a bigger beer selection, but I do just fine with Blue Moon.  I've had a few of their martinis, Mango Madness is my favorite.\n\nAtmosphere: DJ L1 is the buiz.  And on Thursdays they have a live band inside.  I think Thursday is Salsa night?  I wouldn't try to go for serious Salsa dancing though, that place gets packed!  \n\nI'm really picky about going out.  I'm not a fan of clusterf%$ks of people and I have to be in a certain mood to listen to House all night long; but if you say Blue Martini, I'm there.	4
	1147	The bison burger is is absolutely delicious and the black and white shake is just short of addicting howeverthe bill will reach deep into your pocket book so it is definitely not an every day sorry of place	3
	1148	I rate this place 3 stars because it didn't leave an impression on me.\n\nThere was kobe beef, so the good part is that you could get unlimited amounts of it, which my friends all did to make their 40-50 bucks per person worth it. haha\n\nThere was soup, thank goodness. I don't remember seeing/eating icecream...\n\nwell anyways, if I had to compare this buffet with the aria buffet, I'd eat at Arias ANYDAY!	2
	1149	On the menu- tri tip steak and hot link with 2 sides, $22.  What I got- a skewer with 4 overdone pieces of tri tip and 4 small slices of sausage.  My daughter ordered a PB&J sandwich and it was the prepackaged sandwich still in the bag! Very disappointing.  The ribs were decent	1
	1150	"Being completely untrained to all that is sushi, my level of experience rested between \""Tesco/Sainsbury's\"" and \""Is that the one with the peppers in it or the meat?\"" so it was safe to say when I went along to this restaurant I knew I wasn't going to have a clue about anything that was on the menu.\n\nThankfully a few of the good people I had with me knew what was going on and without embarrassing myself I was able to pick up the way the menu worked and what was supposed to happen.\n\nHaving ate a 2ft baguette (don't ask) for lunch I decided I would take it easy so I ordered the salmon maki and the tuna maki and both were lovely. Most of the maki is served in 6's so, as Cressi pointed out, the best way to visit this place would be in a group and have everyone order a few different dishes.\n\nI tried a bit of everyone's and all were wonderfully prepared (and in a few cases cooked). They tasted fresh, sometimes sweet and perfectly filling. Forgive my ignorance on the spelling and pronunciations of the dishes, but I can vouch for what I tried that it was lovely.\n\nIf I could take a moment to bow my head in praise for the wasabi and pickled ginger, at one time I had tears come to my eyes with the initial heat of the wasabi that was rolled beautifully in to a little ball, which of course means it is made right and isn't that funny pasty stuff you get in the supermarket packs.\n\nPerfectly welcoming little restaurant if you fancy a small evening out of throwing a few tables together and going in a group. Bonsai has definitely encouraged me to try all the local sushi bars in Edinburgh."	2
	1151	"You know that little, lesser-known, hole-in-the-wall, amazing restaurant that you wish you could think of on a beautiful Saturday or Sunday morning, to spend your entire morning at, enjoying the weather, sipping fantastic coffee with impeccably made pastries (croissants!), rich b\u00e9chamel sauce on some incredible egg dish and a waiter that just brings you randomly delicious things that you didn't order (and he doesn't charge you for!) because he had them in the back and just thought you might like them? Well, you found it.\n\nThis is the \""little secret place\"" you take your out of town friends to. This is the place you lose track of time at with your good friends, laughing and eating the whole morning away until you leave stuffed, totally happy and ready to relax and enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nLove this place. Easy to recommend. We have wandered in on Saturday and Sunday anywhere between 9 and 11am and never had an issue finding a seat. Very casual experience. Start with a cappuccino, enjoy the fresh hot croissants for a while, maybe get a chocolate one (dear god, so good), maybe another cup of coffee, order some breakfast, talk, laugh and just enjoy.\n\nThen be shocked at the end of this beautiful meal when the bill comes, and it is no more than any other breakfast place and the owner probably didn't even charge you for some of the items just so you'd have a better experience (happened every time we've gone). Vincent's place has a really wonderful/relaxed energy that is all about enjoying your day and we do every time we go."	4
	1152	The bartender at Studio Movie Grill at uptown Charlotte in the Epicenter informed me that she cannot accept state ids except nc state id, I'm from Oakland and my freidn is from New York, we both are in our thirties and have been served everywhere else but Studio Movie Grill.....I was shocked that I was being refused service in 2014 since I've been to North Carolina before, my friend moved here six months ago and never heard this obscure law but we walked away upset and went into the movie as it was starting.....a few minutes later the manager-Johnathan Papkin showed us a print out of the law dismissed us in a very condescending way, we disagreed with what he was saying about that they can refuse us service and he left the paper on our table and we threw it down, we didn't yell at him because we were trying to watch the movie we payed for....that was enough for him to call security, stop the movie, and escorted us out like we were criminals; the security then called the police because we at firts demanded a refund....I spoke to his manager Barrett Covin and he defended this fpoul treatment and tried to blame  us for 37 movie passes he gave to the crowd for the unnecesary disturbance they created....-Do not go there!	0
	1153	I just can't eat at this one since getting terrible service and then going into the restroom only to find it completely devoid of soap.  Yes, you know what that means boys & girls, none of the female staff had soap to wash their hands either.  GROSS!  This was a year or two ago and fingers crossed they're better now but this Z-Tejas location is ruined for me.	0
	1154	You don't want to be here.\n\nThe food is OK, but the price tag is sky high. I spent $86 for three of us eating one burger and two salads along with a sweet potato fries and two drinks. If you drive 5 minutes, you can have the same meal for less than half of the price with even better quality. It used to be a good place with a reasonable price. \n\nI missed their Shoe-String fries.	0
	1155	Yuck!! I can only speak about the breakfast buffet but for $20 plus tip you would think the quality of the food would be a little better. In good Vegas fashion its all flash and no substance. Sure they have all kinds of food,,Chinese, pizza etc (for breakfast) but the quality of the ingredients is low low end. Bruised fruit, rancid tasting hollandaise, smoked salmon that smelled like old socks and watery coffee. Even the lighting is depressing like they only had money left over for some cheapo neon tubes. I guess if I had been drinking and gambling all night I might have enjoyed this before going to my room to sleep it off. My advice, unless drunk skip this place.	0
	1156	"Been here a few times now. Tried the Happy Hour Chicken Quesadilla and it wasn't that impressive. Green peppers were located inside the tortilla, along with way too much chicken that wasn't that tasty at all. The salsa also had no flavor. Not too bad on drink prices as it was about $5 for a can of Guiness and $7 for a Mixed Drink. Since this place is a Vegas icon, it is worth stopping in to check out the firepits and some of their \""girly\"" drinks are pretty famous as well. Entrees are expensive and you can only get appetizers at the bar area. The deserts are not homemade, but the carrot cake was a decent rendition. Worth the trip to see what life was like back in the Vegas glory days (AKA before the Ferris Wheels started arriving in town)."	2
	1157	I'm rating this of my initial experience with this place and my disappointment. I had been wanting to check out this place as I had been hearing great things about the wine and cheese selections plus I drive by  there everyday. \n\nMy friend and I chose to check it out on a mellow weekday afternoon and we did not even eat/drink here because of the initial impression we received. We walked into the front entry and saw there was only one couple at a table and it was slow due to the time of day. We looked around and eventually expected to see anyone who worked there as we awkwardly waited near the hostess stand for several minutes. Finally, a server emerged who did not even acknowledge us in any way and went to help the one table. After that it appeared that a cook or someone from back of house came out to the bar and again did not acknowledge us either. Finally, a couple minutes later the waiter came out into the dining room again and we asked to see a wine list just to get his attention. He then made his way over to hand us a wine list. At that point, we were pretty much over this place as we did not want to see how much worse the service might get if we actually stayed. I was really disappointed that the experience was so bad without even trying the place as I was really looking forward to finding a new downtown restaurant.	0
	1158	So this is hard for me, because Nova's is one of those places i really WANT to like a lot. I mean, i love the idea of Nova's, and i daydream sometimes about taking a leisurely stroll through Plaza Midwood to grab a Sunday morning yummy and some good coffee, but unfortunately i keep leaving unimpressed with everything i try (some of which, not even my kids wanted to finish eating). This is always very disappointing, but actually, probably more of a good thing, since i live so close by. \n\nOn the plus side, they are super friendly, which is why i always consider going back. They are always so kind to my kids, which i love! So kind. They seem to go out of their way to be friendly. My kids LOVE Nova's, and it's so refreshing to go somewhere to grab coffee and have people seem genuinely at peace with you bringing little kids in. My 4-year-old said he is going to work at Nova's when he grows up, and my 5-year-old says she wants visit every day. So kudos to you Nova's, for having the kindest employees!\n\nPros: Super friendly, great with kids, good coffee.\nCons: Entirely unappealing baked goods, slightly pricey.	2
	1159	"It's a few days until my first wedding anniversary, so I thought the the most fitting place to take the prestigious spot of my 50th Review would be the place where we held our wedding dinner reception almost one year ago - Le Village Buffet in the Paris Hotel. \n\nOhhhh yeah. Mmmhhmmm. That's right, we did this buffet style!!! Best believe.  \n\nI'm pretty sure my husband was relieved to see that I did not morph into Bridezilla during the months leading up to our wedding day.  Truth be known, I'm pretty easy to please.  I didn't need the eleborate bells and whistles on my wedding day.  I wanted it to be fun, unpretentious and memorable. Plain and simple.  \n\nSo what better way to please the 90 nearest and dearest friends and family members that made it out to Vegas than to treat them to a meal buffet-style after the ceremony in the Paris Hotel chapel.  It was only $25 a head and there were LOADS and LOADS of food options to choose from.  Forget about the glitz and glamour of a 3 course meal.  No worries on having to add Meat, Fish or Chicken check boxes on our RSVP cards.  I wanted my guests to feel like they could grub on their own terms.  And believe me - the hubby and I both come from families that take food SERIOUSLY.  Our families love food.  So the option of people heading for seconds (and thirds, fourths...) was a plus.  Being that it was the Paris hotel, the menu echoed of French dishes. The food was amazingly delicious for a buffet!   They were even able to provide us with a private section of the restaurant just for our party.  The decor was breathtaking - the ceilings were painted to look like a bright blue sky with puffs of white clouds.  The floors mimicked cobblestone sidewalks and the buffet stations were made to look like old French houses.   Each \""Station\"" showcased food from the 6 different regions of France.They were also able to provide our awesome 3 tier wedding cake (vanilla cake with fresh berries) and champagne for the toast.    We received nothing but praises from our guests on how outstanding the food was.  \n\nI had to go to Vegas for business during the summer of '07 and I took my husband with me.  Where did we stop for our first meal? Uh huh, Le Village Buffet.  We heard so much about the awesome Breakfast/Brunch buffet that they had, we had to give it a go.  And it was sooooo worth it.  In fact, I'll be heading back to Vegas on business again in a couple of weeks, and the Le Village Buffet will definitely be on my itinerary."	4
	1160	"The food here is awesome... Great Steaks (1/2 off on Sunday is the best thing going on in Summerlin) and the salads are fantastic too. \n\nHowever ... the front staff is not the greatest when it comes to service.\n\nI pop in at least twice a week because the food is so good and it's conveniently close to home but the staff can't seem to remember my name or even want to take the time to learn it. \n\nGood food.. no doubt that's what keeps us coming back.\n\nAs always... show up for the 1/2 price Steak Sunday ... my friend and I pretty much eat out daily all across the local places in Las Vegas so we know what we are talking about when it comes to local Vegas eats.\n\nOur last trip around we were not drinking too much... switch to water and Iced Tea which pretty much went empty as the waitress was too busy doing who knows what. \n\nWe eat and before we are even done with our steaks, the waitress brings us our bill. No mention of desserts or coffee even offered. Seems as if she was more interested in closing out our bill and having us hit the road then stick around...\n\nLuckily Dunkin Donuts is right next door... \n\nThe last three experiences have been somewhat similar. I could certainly understand the attitude if we did not tip so well.... but we generally always tip well above 20% on every outing.\n\nOne last shot next \""Steak\"" Sunday and if the service is the same... it may be time to look for other places where the front staff does appreciate us. That's what being local is really all about. \n\nSometimes.... it's just the little things that matter even if you do have a great thing going on."	2
	1161	Great environment - sleek decor. Food from rural China skillfully brought to Vegas with panache. \nWatch the cook throw dough around and make noodles and then order it.  \nI come here everytime I stop by the Caesars Palace, even when I'm not hungry. Since I'm staying in CP this time, my second time eating here in 3 days.	3
	1162	Jose Andres' Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan fuses traditional Spanish tapas with a trendy ambiance and confirms the celebrity chef still knows what he's doing.\n\nJaleo was our last dinner outing on a recent Vegas trip and it did not disappoint. The food was outstanding from start to finish. A trendy decor perfectly at home in the Cosmo proved to be the perfect setting for a style of dining that encourages a communal experience.\n\nThe menu spans multiple regions of Spain and showcases some of their most popular cuisine. Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico and paella are probably the best known dishes to an American audience but Jaleo's menu goes far beyond the staples offering a unique mix with something for every palate.\n\nThe Good: Jaleo's menu features a number of different paellas, but keep in mind that they rotate on a nightly basis, also make sure to order them early as they take 45 minutes to prepare. We opted for the vegetable paella which was packed with flavor. The rice was a perfect al-dente and had a nice bite to it. The portion was a bit on the small side so be sure to order 2 if you have a larger group. The Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico did not disappoint either. Sliced paper-thin, the fat marbled ham had a great saltiness finished with hit of acorn. Another standout were the Croquetas De Pollo (chicken fritters). They weren't unlike risotto balls I've had in the past with a molten cheese center. They were a nice balance to the bold, spicy flavors of the other dishes. Ultimately you really can't go wrong with anything on Jaleo's menu. We sampled about 10-12 dishes total and they were all outstanding. Be sure to start your meal with one of the restaurant's signature gin and tonics.\n\nThe Bad: Nothing bad to report. We did have to wait an extra 15 minutes past our reservation to be seated, but the friendly bar tenders took good care of us while we waited. The service was also a bit slow, but that's more attributed to just how busy the restaurant was. Make sure you book a table in advance.\n\nJaleo is a quintessentially Vegas dining experience. It's great for groups and the vibrant atmosphere and stunning food will keep me coming back.	4
	1163	Christian is so awesome! I went to her after someone gave me an awful cut and even though I didn't have much hair to work with she was able to make a masterpiece! \nMy mother is also a hairdresser so I am a little hard to please when it comes to a good cut but Christian honestly blew me away! I kid you not, I have been stopped on the street by people asking who cuts my hair! \nNot only have I become a repeat client but I have now got my husband to be an avid client as well! (This is coming from a man who said he would never go anywhere but a barber shop!) My mother has even gone to see Christian a few times and my mother (who has been cutting hair for about 30 years now) is also blown away! \nI can go on and on but I think you need to just see for yourself. I don't think there's anything Christian can't do and her pricing is beyond affordable. Do yourself a favor and give her a call!	4
	1164	Had a business dinner here last night.  Granted there were 20 of us, however dinner took in excess of 3.5 hours.  For the group that large we weren't allowed the full menu and the courses still took and extremely long time to get to us.\nTwo of the lobster spaghettis got sent back for being way overcooked, and one fish was exchanged entirely for being bad.\nMy filet was not bad.	1
	1165	The food is usually good, upscale Mexican.	3
	1166	Blue 32 never disappoints. We eat here at least 2x a month and have never had a bad experience. The food is yummy, the restaurant is clean and the service is great. I especially love the philly, buffalo chicken salad and the turkey club.	4
	1167	Very knowledgeable staff with interesting and diverse inventory.	3
	1168	zzZZzzz thats all I have to say.	2
	1169	"BAD. AWFUL. THE WORST.\n\nOne of the worst dining experiences of my life that I keep trying to forget, but I just can't. And I have to share my experience so that some other well-meaning tourist does NOT give this place a try. \n\nIn February, my man and I were visiting his family in the area. We drove to hike at the mountains, but ended up stopping for lunch instead. Our party of 5 arrived at 12:30 on a Sunday. When we asked if they were still open, the waiter replied, \""I guess you'll be the last table\"". Umm, your hours say that you are open until 2pm on Sundays. In this economy, I don't think it's smart to turn business away, but maybe that's just me. This was the first sign of a problem and we should have walked out, but I try to be agreeable and go with the group. It was one awful thing after another: the waiter argued with our drink orders after we told him he brought the wrong thing, it took over 30 minutes to bring our chips & salsa for appetizers and the portions were insanely small. If chips and salsa cost money, you can at least give me more than 25 chips! An hour (yes, 1 hour) after ordering, the food came out 1 dish at a time. The veggie burger was just as ordered and bowl of soup was fine. The sandwich my boyfriend's nephew ordered was with the wrong meat and cheese. We heard a whole bunch of yelling with curse words and couldn't tell where it was coming from, but quickly realized that it was the cook in the kitchen. The cook seemed to be pissed off at what we ordered and didn't want to make it. My chicken sandwich came out next.  I cut it in half to discover that the CHICKEN WAS NOT FULLY COOKED. Seriously disgusting. My boyfriend's trio of \""sliders\"" came out on 3 plates with the beef, pork and other meats partially charred (not in a good way) and the bread haphazardly thrown on top. I don't think it was supposed to be \""build it yourself\"". We heard more yelling from the cook and then heard, \""I'm f***ing done with this place\"" as the cook threw off their apron and stormed out. The waiter was clearly ashamed  and apologized for the cook. After some convincing, he reluctantly removed the chicken sandwich and sliders from our bill and we tried to leave as quickly as possible.\n\nOnce again, I would like to say that I hate writing bad reviews.... But if I had read a review similar to mine, we would have never come to this horrible place to \""piss off\"" the cook so much. Lesson learned!\n\nNote to the staff: It would be better to turn business away than give your patrons horrible service and be pissed off yourselves as well."	0
	1170	"I have gone it to this location on three separate times. Each time the same girl has worked at the counter and each time I have felt that i was bothering her by being there to shop or sell, two of the three times I was the only person in the shop. During my last visit i walked in and saw the girl sitting down at the counter talking on the phone, I waited at the counter and waited for her to acknowledge me. Once she decided to acknowledge me, she said \""can I help you with something\"" (with a tone of attitude) and slide the phone slightly away from her mouth. I asked my question and she gave her response as if i was disturbing her phone call and should come back when she felt like having visitors. Overall she was very unwilling to help me as a customer and was completely rude. If I didn't live as close as I do, i would never go back. I don't think she was an owner but if i find that she is i will never go back. If she is hired help for the store, i highly suggest that the owner looks into the customer service that they are providing because it was completely inappropriate for myself on three occasions, My husband had the same experience twice and refuses to go back based on the service."	0
	1171	Enjoyed the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairing last night.  Loved the Pork with Goat's Cheese, Figs and Bananas Bruleed in Rum the best.  Every wine was a perfect compliment to the course. The ambiance is so charming! Complimenting the creative and wonderful tasting food was our waitress who had a wicked sense of humor to match my own and she was very knowledgeable.  I wish I could remember her name!  Kudos to the manager who accommodated my daughter and I on our Groupon with very short notice.  That was super cool!	4
	1172	It's been a while since I've had a Quizno's Sandwich.  Groupon had a deal and I bought a few of them, so I had to come here.  I had a regular Italian on Parmesan Bread w/Chips.  It was bleh....there was too much Dressing on the Sandwich and it overpowered the flavors.  Also, the Bread lacked flavor.  \n\nIf it wasn't for the Groupons, I wouldn't come back.\n\nReturn Factor - 20%	1
	1173	Although Tryst is Wynn's first nightclub child, the newer XS has taken over as the prettier, more popular sibling. Surrender tried to be just like XS with good effort, but I think XS has them beat in size and popularity. Tryst still gets packed, but getting in is so much easier. A promoter approached my friends and I earlier this day and offered to comp us a free bottle since we had 18 girls. He told us we could stop by Tryst first, then we can head over to XS without any problems. Wait, did he say free alcohol?? Not only is free alcohol a given for girls in Vegas, but also a dream come true. \n\nI've been to Tryst a few times, but I can't recall details as much as I'd like to. There is a beautiful waterfall outside, but I don't think Tryst has the same wow factor that XS has when you walk through the door. It's a cool club, but I don't usually stay there too long before moving on to the next place. The dance floor is small from what I can remember and moving around is tough since there are so many people. Overall, a great place to start the night, but I'd move onto bigger and better at the Encore.	3
	1174	What a great new place downtown!  Neighborhood bar comfort. Feels like home.  Wish I lived closer. It would be a regular nightly hangout.\n\nIt's only been open 6 weeks and on a weeknight there was standing room only and the parking lot was full. Local beers on tap . . . plus their own..  Menu included plenty of choices and everything I saw come out of that small kitchen was scarfed up without a crumb left on the plates. . . . and the servings were generous. \n\nAnother great new addition to the continuing eateries and breweries in the greater Phoenix Valley of the Sun. Try it. You will not be disappointed. Wanna meet there for a burger and a beer? Maybe two? Tomorrow night?	4
	1175	Music is always good - love the classic rock playlist.  Fish is mostly good for almost every dish on menu.  Most is fresh which is hard to filings in Vegas.  Marty bartender is awesome.  He came from Shucks on Eastern & Serene.  Tons of TVs.  Good local vibe.  My favorite dish is the blackened chicken tacos with their signature salsa.	4
	1176	A work colleague came here and was regailing us with tales of plentiful good food and all you can eat plus a free drink for \u00a37.50. On a trip into town for work he mentioned this again, so off all 3 of us trecked to drummond street to check out the smorgasbord of curry we have been hearing about. \n\nFirst impressions nice enough looking place both inside and out with a friendly welcome on arrival. Looking good so far. Drinks served IRN-BRU and mango juices all round. Now the food...\n\nEverything looked the part from the pilau rice through to the curries but something was missing.... the smell of the spices. I always judge a curry place on their Dal and this was not good it tasted sweet and the lentils had turned to mush. Think slighty curried / spiced mashed potatoe for texture.. urgh. The rice, Bhuna, sag and tandoori chicken were pleasant enough. The Madras wihich was potatoe and lamb reminded me of irish stew, which my colleague reminded I loudly proclaimed at the table. \n\nOverall not offensive just lacking a bit in depth of flavours I guess for the food. Lots of food for your money and the service was good, but the food is a bit bland for my palate. With so many options close by I dont think I would be rushing back.	1
	1177	I've been to Ground Control for coffee, beer, and food, but would only return for the beer, of which they have a great selection and reasonable prices.\n\nThey have a beautiful La Marzocca espresso machine, but their in-house roasted beans taste inferior to many mass-produced brands.\n\nThe one time I ordered food it was pathetic:  Pizze margherita that were over-sauced and under-cooked,  buffalo mozzarella tasted off,  no cornichone, no char, and no spotting.  The Phoenix area probably has more awesome neopolitan style pizzerias per-capita that any city in the U.S., but ground control's pizza is barely edible. The poutine and wings were even worse--like what would happen if some some highschool stoner friend was given access to commercial cooking equipment.	1
	1178	To my surprise this little country stop has veggie options! I ordered the veggie pizza sans cheese and my boyfriend ordered the honey chicken with fries. While waiting for our meals to arrive I meandered the adjoining store. Among the little nick-knacks is a seriously impressive desert case with many different pies, cakes, and crumbles. Sadly no vegan options here. As far as the food goes our entrees were decent but not memorable. We appreciated the snack on our way to the Wildlife Park!	2
	1179	I loved this place pho was awesome taro smoothie was good as well but the service was slow no body going around filling waters . Sucks because I really wanted to love this place . Everybody was nice tho I just hate when places let that slack everybody was talking and looking at computers and tablets kinda sucks when their was only 3 tables when I was their	2
	1180	Nice quick downtown lunch spot.  Went there because they were included on my WILL Member Benefit card. I'd been there before for coffee - which is also good.\n\nI had a cup (generous portion) of the Roasted Red Pepper Soup special and a Portobello toast - artfully assembled open face sandwich.  My companion had a cup of Jambalaya and turkey toast and a cup of tea.  \n\nThere were quite a few customers enjoying the cozy atmosphere and free WiFi.	3
	1181	This is the place if you like your wine or ale to be anything but run of the mill. A big favourite for members of our clan at Christmas was the Nole Beer. Steep at \u00a312.50 a bottle, but very special and very festive. Similarly, a number of wines sold here cannot be found in your everyday wine shop and stock changes regularly, so there is always something new to try. Staff are well informed and happy to advise if you let them know your preferred taste in wine or beer. A little pricier but it is to be expected.	3
	1182	I guess I am not in the Trailhead club.\n\nWalking into a new place can sometimes be a bit awkward.  Where to go, where to stand, seat yourself or not, these things are not always evident.   So I walk into the Trailhead Cafe, not knowing what to expect.  All I know is that it marries my two favorite things:  Bicycles and Food.  It is Sunday morning and a breakfast sandwich soundas great.  \n\nOk Cut to the chase.\n\nI actually never ate at this cafe.   I could not get sanyone to greet me, let alone take an order.  I walked in slowly - trying to get a bearing on this new joint.  I took the universal stance infront of the food counter, which suggest I might want to order something.  A young man after a few minutes showed up behind the counter, made eye contact and did not say a single word to me.  Ok - so he was busy, I never want to be that guy.  He proceeds to chat with a couple of friends.  I figured I would look at some of the kool bikes and let him finish.  After a poilite trip around the shop (on my part), I went again to the counter and took that universal pose of I am ready to order now.  2 or 3 people walk past me, and not a word.  I figured, I was not part of the Trailhead scene and sheepishly made my way for the exit.  15 minutes wasted and still no food or drink.\n\nNow - I know that this must be an anomalie as fellow yelpers like this joint.  I gotta say that this put a bad taste in my mouth (really no taste at all).  I will probably go back and give it a try.  I hope I have a better experience.   \n\nThis definately falls under the category of a hasty response, but hey businesses go down all the time because of this type of negligent service.  It is a competitve market out there and every guest is huge.  Hope my second try, whenever that may be, goes a bit better.\n\nA	0
	1183	"Is it wrong to travel 1500 miles across the country just for dinner? Not so crazy if that place is Lawry's. My last meal would be from here, for crying out loud! Not only is the prime rib the best anywhere, but the sides are the best I've ever had as well. The creamed corn, spinach, mashed potatoes and yorkshire pudding are so good......as they say in the south, it'll \""make you want to get up and slap yo momma\"".\n\nI'll be eating here in less than a week - I can't wait!!!"	4
	1184	Very disappointed with my order, first it took 15 minutes to get my order and then when I got my order my coffee ( caramel frappuchino) was so nasty and didn't even taste good, it was all melted and lacked taste. Do not recommend going there.	0
	1185	I was on a mission to get hot chocolate and recalled that this place was open 24-hrs! What time was it? It was about 4:30am or so. After breaking even on my day's gamble, I decided to head over to Le Caf\u00e9 Ile St. Louis  to get my cup of joy (hot chocolate:D ).\n\nWhen I ordered my hot chocolate, the guy (or barista/bartender) looked at me like I was weird and then he carded me. Since when do you get carded for a hot chocolate? I mean, I know it features a full bar that is open 24 hours, but still.  What if I was under 21, would he of refused my right for a hot chocolate? \n\nWell, the hot chocolate did not taste  that good. Denny's hot chocolate is better! Or better yet, I should of  shown him how to make it better. It was too watery.\n\nAnyhow, I have eaten at this restaurant. It's basically an overpriced upscale IHOP :/. The seating and the decor is what raises the dollar signs of this place.	1
	1186	Same as it was 20 years ago. Went for lunch after recently returning to the valley of the sun. Not much to write about my lunch. Portion was small. just some breaded chicken some sickeningly sweet sauce and some walnuts. Boring. I had the hot and sour soup that was oddly thick and had WAY too much tofu. The place inside was dark and old and seemed dirty. The bathroom opens to the dining area, so that made it seem worse. Probably wont be back. Disappointing. I remember something better. but maybe its because i was young and hadnt experienced a better place.	1
	1187	For the little time we spent at fat heads I got an awesome vibe, the crowd was friendly and the beer list was amazing of course, I had the blueberry beer and it smelled like pancakes, I would love to go back and try something off the extensive menu next time I'm in town.	3
	1188	Absolutely horrible.  Went to the first location at Tatum and Cave Creek.  Told her I needed spray tan.  She let me fill out paperwork while she chatted away on her phone and then told me the one sprayer they had was down. Not sure why she didn't tell me at first.  Then sent me to the location a mile away. Got to the next location and my information wasn't entered correctly from the first so she had to find someone else to fix it.  Then after paying, and 30 minutes of trying, found their sprayer was broken too. They told me I'd have to wait 2-3 days and then call back to speak with a manager about getting a refund for the services I never received. You take an hour of my life and my money and won't even refund it when you can't provide the service? Horrible. Bunch of kids running the place with a manager who has no idea what customer service is about.	0
	1189	L'endroit est bien situ\u00e9 sur la rue ontario, accessible via l'autobus Ontario ou l'autobus papineau. Je m'attendais a un genre de comptoir/cantine , mais c'est une belle fa\u00e7ade rouge et de vraies tables qui nous attendent au Poutineville. Un bar complet et du service au tables compl\u00e8tent l'exp\u00e9rience. Le serveur \u00e9tait super gentil et dr\u00f4le, et nous a accomod\u00e9 avec gentillesse lorsque nous avons ajout\u00e9 une table pour pouvoir recevoir des amis qui sont arriv\u00e9s plus tard. \n\nAp\u00e9ro : une pinte de cheval blanc super froide contrastant avec la chaleur et l'humidit \u00e9 de la journ\u00e9e, \u00e7a a vraiment fait du bien. Le menu vari\u00e9 a tent\u00e9 plusieurs de mes compatriotes pendant que moi j'ai choisi les ingr\u00e9dients a la carte : frites \u00e9cras\u00e9s (la sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 maison), fromage cheddar, boeuf hach\u00e9, piments verts et oignons caram\u00e9lis\u00e9s. d\u00e9licieux !\n\nLe prix est un peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour une poutine, mais la fra\u00eecheur des ingr\u00e9dients et le service impeccable en ont valu le coup.	4
	1190	Their food is pretty good.  I love their Pizzas, however their wine totally sucks. I know this is a Brewery folks and I go with people who like to try their different beers, but since I don't drink beer, what's in it for me?  Their wine is so terrible, their selection is so poor that it spoils my whole evening.\n\nI have been there a couple of times and their wine selection has changed over time, but it seems they pick the same type of wine every time.  No body, no favor.  Yuck!  Come on folks, find someone who knows wine to pick a good selection.	1
	1191	Hubby and I decided to try after getting a coupon in the mail. The minute we walked in the guy told us they had no chicken, beef or turkey. It was only 6 pm. The lady that checked us out was rude not only to us, but other patrons. The staff was not friendly in general... It was just an uncomfortable dining experience and we won't be returning. Oh and the food is just mediocre... Nothing special.	1
	1192	SO and I ordered again, and the calzones were much greasier this time and generally less tasty. We also tried the cheese bread sticks which neither of us liked.	1
	1193	I've attempted to come to Bachi Burger the last 3x I've been to Vegas and I FINALLY got to try it this last trip! There's always a long wait and now I can see why. The hype was real. \n\nWe started with oxtail chili cheese fries and truffle fries. Both made my stomach so happy. If that were the only things I got to try this trip I would've left completely satisfied. I'm pretty much a sucker for anything with a fried egg on top. The fries were crispy, the chili was tasty, and the sunny side egg just completed the dish. The truffle fries came with a brown sauce on top. I have not the slightest idea of what it was, but it sure added to my truffle fries experience.\n\nAlso on the list of things I ordered were pork belly steamed buns with the houses sauce on the side. The pork belly was crispy on the sides and had so much flavor! (I'm drooling again...) BF ordered the spicy miso burger medium. It was saucy and messy and just the way I like my burgers. My experience with burgers have always been... The messier they are the happier I am with it. \n\nThey also own the ramen spot next door and you can order ramen if that's more your craving. I can't wait to come back for more oxtail fries.	4
	1194	(Note:  Kit C.'s review should actually be under the Walnut Street location of C.T. Roasters.  This particular location on Forbes Ave is in Squirrel Hill.)\n\nAnd onwards!\n\nI worked here in Pittsburgh for a few months and had a blast.  The early morning (i.e., 5:30 AM) wasn't the most desirable, but this place has a really regular crowd with some newbies interspersed here and there.  (It isn't hard to get in with the regulars, either.)  The space at the Squirrel Hill location is a bit limited.  Weather permitting, there are two tables outside, so there's ample opportunity for people watching along this main road in Squirrel Hill--lots of folks stroll by throughout the day.  There are a handful of tables up front and then a handful more back past the coffee bar.  (The store itself is sort of shaped like a long rectangle.)  \n\nI was about to give the place four stars when I realized I had no cause to from a customer's perspective, and no cause to from my own, either.  I had a great time working there, but that's not what this review is about.  Let's talk about the place, shall we?  The owners and  manager(s?) LOVE coffee.  They will make (and train their employees to make) fancypants espresso drinks with very high-quality products and have really nice teas on hand, but coffee beans are their strength.  The beans are freshly roasted very frequently, and if you buy whole beans (and choose to have them remain whole or have a staff person grind 'em up), the date of the roasting will be marked on your coffee bag so you know just how fresh it is.  I'd had thousands of cups of coffee before working there and have had hundreds since:  nowhere was it fresher or was the supply better maintained.  \n\nThe staff is really friendly and tends to remember your order after you've been in just a handful of times.  This notion sometimes frightens me--if the coffee shop boy is remembering my order, does that  mean I need to get a life and/or go to a different joint?  NO, people.  Don't worry about it.  Bask in the pleasure of someone having done this very simple thing for you.  And trust me:  the baristas do NOT find it strange if you come in several times a week.  They don't find it all that weird if you're in several times a day.  \n\nI've seen varying comments on the pastries--I think one bakery supplies all the Coffee Tree locations.  I liked the sweets last time I was in town but it's been at least a year for me; perhaps things have changed.  \n\nOrder your coffee of the day for here and you get it in a porcelain cup, plus you get one free refill!  (A paper cup holds no such joy.)	4
	1195	"It breaks my heart to give a one star review, but here we go:  \n\nOn one trip I had some basic repairs done to my car and the rep told me it wasn't covered under warranty.  I saved hundreds of dollars by putting my foot down and telling him I wouldn't pay till he looked up my warranty. \n\nToday a salesman called me trying to get me to buy some new wheels because my car is over 97K miles.  I politely declined saying I'm very happy with my current ride, and \""Nissans go on forever\"".  He continued the sales pitch by asking me if I have any money.  Bad, Riverview, bad!  OK, that's all."	0
	1196	The worst service  I've ever had. I would have been upset about the service but the food was even worse. Do NOT go HERE. You will be sick with disappointment.	0
	1197	When I have a coupon or deal, I like to double check to make sure they'll still honor it. I had to ask three people here if they would honor it no one knew and no one offered to find out. Food was fine but the sauce is very sweet. Not what I expected. Booths were large enough to be comfortable.	1
	1198	*Disclaimer. If you are my future cardiologist please avert your eyes toward a different review*\n\nOh my dearest butters, you had me at your name, and I was oh so glad your food didn't disappoint. I'm sure this is in direct correlation toward your namesake being a main ingredient in all your dishes. Well, before I dive into how great the food is (so great by the way), let me get the frivolous details out of the way. First off, the interior is light and fun, the staff is great- couldn't be more on point, and the patio is large and dog friendly. Occasionally there can be a bit of a wait, so if you happen to go at primetime on a weekend don't be tempted to leave, they have no problem with you popping over to the Village Coffee Roastery for a one of the best lattes in town  (but that's a different review for a different time). \n\nOk, now down to business. I have eaten breakfast at Butters four times now and it's been a home run each time. In fact I've even turned other breakfast loyalists toward Butters for their new favorite spots. Whatever you order it comes out fast and hot. Lately I have been partial to the California scramble- eggs, grilled chicken, avocado, and cheddar. Other greats are the omelets- full of goodness and as big as your face. Even the traditionals (eggs benedict, biscuits and gravy, or breakfast burritos) hold their own as well. And the coup de gr\u00e2ce, almost all the egg dishes come with your choice of pancakes!! Yes, you heard me right. Or you can even sub for French toast or a waffle. All of which are light and fluffy to perfection. \n\nLong story short, if you like breakfast, this is your spot. Just bring your appetite cuz you're going to need it.	4
	1199	We went there and had a drink and some wings. We are from the East coast and have been to the place that has the original wings. They were okay but the chicken is pressed and seemed very chicken nugget for the boneless and the sauce wasn't that great on the regular bone in traditional. Maybe we are just picky. We wanted to try their pizza but the ppl behind us complained the dough wasn't cooked. We aren't sure if we want to go back or not	1
	1200	I have always wanted to see BMG and I'm so sad to say that it was disappointing.. \n\nluckily we bought our tix from tix4tonite as  we had amazing seats in the middle, row K. But the show... \nWay too many Exchanges of Awkward faces between the Blue Men and creeping around the audience. I paid to see you guys perform and play music not to walk on seats into the audience and pull up people to awkwardly eat a Twinkie onstage for 10 mins. The best part of the show was the end with the smoke rings passing the giant balls around and the paint flying when they were drumming, When they actually did the sh** that made them famous and cool. \n\nI'm glad I got all of our tix for half price each. I would NEVER pay full price or ever be in a rush to see them again.	1
	1201	"I went there a couple weeks ago with my girlfriend and we decided to order the french toast and a side of scrambed eggs with spinach and chicken sausage. The food was pretty good especially the french toast, but the service didn't match. Well I guess the service did match...the name that is. If the food wasn't as good as it was  I would've given this place 2 stars. My girlfriend wanted to order coffee and they told her that they were all out. There was only one pot sitting at the counter and it was empty. One pot??? For a place this big they only make one pot of coffee??? A couple of minutes after we ordered our food a two people walked up and ordered theirs. Our food came out somewhat fast, but theirs did not. They didnt get their food until at least 15 min after we ate ours. A couple of others walked up to order coffee and the host/server said they were out. The guy asked if they could make more but all the server could say was \""we've been getting orders for coffee all day and we keep running out.\"". The guy asks if they could make more and the server just throws his arms up. The man looked pretty upset and just walked away. He couldve just took a couple mins to brew a fresh batch but didn't. This place needs to get better training for their servers."	2
	1202	I am a rookie cyclist. I recently stopped by Global to buy a few replacement parts. They could not have been friendlier or more helpful. They definitely went above and beyond to help me and answer my stupid questions.  I will be going back.	4
	1203	Is it me, or do all the gorgeous people somehow end up in XS? Write this down - get glammed up, or else you'll feel out of place.\n\nI take back my previous 3-star review. Next to TAO, this is one of my favorite clubs in Vegas. The decor is absolutely breathtaking and I love the spaciousness of both the dance floor and the outdoor pool. \n\nDid you know you can dance in the pool?? So awesome.\n\nUnlike a lot of other party spots in LV, security inside isn't too strict about groups of drunkies raiding empty tables and beds. There's so many VIP areas available, you won't have someone breathing down your neck if you want to steal one to rest your feet for a few minutes. \n\nHowever, I can't say the same thing about the bouncers in front managing the line.\n\nThey've gotten a bit more organized about their lines now (THANK GOODNESS), but the guys that work them are still pricks that want ridiculous tips for a favor. With that being said, I've learned a trick that I think everyone should take into consideration:\n\n- Get in line by 9:30 (make sure you scout for passes beforehand if you're a lady)\n- Get stamped by 10.\n- Go back up to your room for drinks.\n- Come back down at midnight and pass up the fat line that wraps around to the Wynn Theater.\n\nWhy does this work? - You'll only need to wait about 20-30 minutes rather than over an hour, you'll get a good buzz without having to drop bills at the bar, you'll get to feel like VIP walking past everyone else standing in line when you return, and the music doesn't really get goin' until after 12am anyway.\n\nI'm a genius. Thank me later. ;)	4
	1204	Great food, great service, great scenery.... What more do you want?! Alexis our waitress was quick and helpful giving us the highlights of the popular dishes as well as her favorites. The fish tacos and the chicken BLT were perfect and all in front of the fantastic view of the massive fish tank. Good stop if you're on Fremont street or staying at the GN. Cheers!	4
	1205	Don't let my 3 stars fool you.....I am actually a pretty big fan of this place and look forward to returning. I have been twice but the experiences were different, hence the 3 stars. The first time I went with my husband and we were seated at one of the community tables. They asked us if we were okay with that and it is was fine. The more the merrier! I had a glass of their rose wine and ordered their salad that came with avocados, grapefruit, beets, mint, arugula, goat cheese, and a orange vinaigrette. I asked them to leave off the grapefruit, beets, and add salami. I thoroughly enjoyed it, wow! However, the second time I had it, I ordered it the exact same way (but for take-out instead), and when I ate it, it was way too tart. I could barely eat it which stunk because I was really looking forward to having it again. Other than that, i liked the environment. It is really chill, I loved all of the windows which brought alot of light into the restaurant. I will definitely go back especially since it has become a fave among my husband and friends.	2
	1206	This wonderful woman is so good at keeping my wardrobe up to date! If you are trying to get the most of your fashion budget, why not update what you have?\nI have been using her for years. She is fast and very good. She can shorten hems to update a dress or skirt. Or maybe you need her to make your skinny jeans skinnier, she can do it. You can even take her things that you bought on sale that maybe were not just the right fit. Elizebeth is your gal. She is also great at repairs.\nDefinitely a thrifty find for all you budget minded fashionistas out there. Now clean out your closet!	4
	1207	Although the place is beautiful, the food was horrible. Worst salsa EVER, it tasted store bought. The fish taco was barely edible, poor quality fish and it was $11. I ordered a Patron margarita, since I like tequila, and it tasted like water! We told the waitress, and she got me a new one, but it was only slightly better and I still don't think it was Patron. They charge for chips & salsa...the food is expensive and they charge for chips too?? Would not go back!!!	1
	1208	Got three types of pupusas from there to try, cheese and cheese, beans and cheese, and beef and cheese. Would not recommend. Tasted heavily of grease and bread and not much else. Not sure why my newspaper recommended that item.	0
	1209	"Maybe I came there on an \""off-day\""... or maybe it's just not as good as it seemed by the reviews. \n\nI wish I could take back the 2 hours we spent there.  I'm very thankful we didn't have to wait outside for a table...\n\nHonestly, I've experienced better.  There are so many places to eat in Las Vegas, and I would make this one of the last places I would ever want to go back to.  The place looks like a gem, compared to everything else in that strip mall.  Perhaps their going for a \""hole in the wall\"" effect. But overall, their prices and taste don't match up, in my opinion.  \n\nThe service was not so good.  The table next us complained numerous times about the waitress not getting their food right. I wasn't happy about seeing an automatic charge of 18% gratuity being automatically added to our bill.  -- There were only 3 of us.  I know we were pleasant guests since we had a very simple order and didn't demand anything of the staff. \n\nWhat did we order?\nBeef Penang - it was ok\nPad Thai - ok\nCrispy Prawns - or whatever that expensive appetizer was called - ok\n\nI am a person that likes to Instagram good food from places I like to eat.  I seriously didn't have the heart to do so for this place... I just couldn't do it it my friends. I wouldn't want them to waste time here either. \n\nI hate writing bad reviews.  But I seriously am still not happy with the time and dollars I spent there. The money  I can always replace, but the time wasted during our vacation I'll never get back."	1
	1210	The only major negative was the 45 minute wait to get in.\nThis buffet is located in the Paris. I went for brunch.\nThe pastries were all amazingly delicious. I also really liked the waffles and crepes, although the crepes could have benefited from a bit more fruit filling from the less than personable crepe maker. The meats were all pretty good (bacon, sausage, sirloin, pork loin) and I also liked the domas. Fruits, crab legs, eggs, hashbrowns, salads...quite a wide variety of things to pick from. \nNot the very best of the Vegas buffets but certainly in the second tier.	3
	1211	"I have to say that I was much more excited about this place BEFORE I went to it. It isn't a bad bar, per se- but definitely did not live up to the hype. and the drinks are more pricey than they should be for the flavor.  If I can make a better margarita than a place called \""Margaritaville\"", well- then I will save myself the money and make them at home.  However- when they do the live music on the weekends- it is a great time."	1
	1212	Picked up food to go for 4 people from here and the experience was decent for my friends and awful for me. I became very sick after eating their Tofu Pad See Ew. I'm have no idea why this place have 4 starts. There are much better Thai food places in the Las Vegas area than this place. Here's my breakdown:\n\nService: Excellent. Since we picked it up, all I can comment on is how quickly they completed my order. I will say that they got the order 100% correct and had it promptly completed. \n\nFood: Here was our order.\nPad Thai Chicken-  Average. Greasy. Heavy.\nPad See Ew Tofu- Tasted great; however, 10 minutes after I finished eating it I became horribly ill from it. \nPad See Ew Chicken- Average.\nChicken Curry Green- Average.\nStuffed Chicken Wings- TERRIBLE! No flavor and just overall odd.\nSpring Rolls Veggie- Tasty. I recommend.\n\nPrice: Decent. The above order amounted to $60.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for Thai food go somewhere else or eat here and have a ton of Pepto-Bismol on hand. Trust me, you're going to need it.	1
	1213	Stopped in here in way to get a Thai massage next door. It is well lit and the staff is friendly.  The food seemed heavenly although there were big chunks of raw onion in the spring rolls.  The tom kha with mushroom is a delicious sour coconut soup with a touch of herbs. I really enjoyed it. \n\nIf you are veggie this is a great spot to avoid strip prices and get tasty Thai food!	3
	1214	This place is awesome. If I lived downtown, I would be here 3-4 times a week (especially during happy hour). The experience is just a bit pricey, for my meager budget, but when I splurge I come here. \n\nThe food is tasty. I've tried the burger and fries (yummy, especially the fries), the mahi mahi salad (fabulous), shrimp lahvosh (a no-brainer to order), and the fish tacos. The first time I had the fish tacos I couldn't stop thinking about my next visit for over a week. Then I went again a week or so ago and either (1) they changed the recipe, (2) the restaurant gods conspired against my enjoyment, or (3) my expectations were so high that I was let down. As a former server/bartender myself, I am inclined to go with 1, unfortunately. \n\nThe fish taco experience has not affected my will to revisit the Local Breeze, no way. Not only do they have other tasty food, they also have some pretty darn good drinks. If you are to planning to simply have a drink or planning on drinking your dinner, go with the cucumber martini. As a male I generally stay away from martinis, but bring on the jokes because this one is [choose your dramatic word . . . epic/phenomenal/unbelievable]. \n\nOh, and the corn hole is fun to play, and watch. Not sure what I am going to do during the hot Phoenix summers. I will figure something out.	4
	1215	I ate at Swad the other night and was a little underwhelmed.\n\nI tried their Chicken Tikka, and it was fine. I think it was around $13-14 for a pretty small portion. A friend ordered the Goat Curry, and for about the same price had even worse luck. His meal was chock full of goat bones and very little meat, making it a terrible value.\n\nI've had better Indian food in Madison, and at a much more affordable price point. I'm really confused why dinner at Swad costs so much. The portions aren't even that big!\nIt's a nice, intimate space and the staff members were all very nice. But for my money, I'll stick with Maharaja or Taste of India.	2
	1216	"Great service. Good bar food. Interesting \""regulars\""...liked the fact that there was pool tables."	2
	1217	"Went thru the drive thru at dinnertime.  Was fast and efficient.  Dallas assisted me by making a suggestion when I asked a question on which \""Go Cup\"" I should order. I went with his suggestion and went with the 2 chicken strips and wedges. Excellent value for $2.99 . Will definitely be back."	4
	1218	"*(My Circus Circus Nightmares)* \nWorst place to stay in Vegas! \nThey just don't care! \nWe made a reservation because my daughter had Cheer Nationals in Vegas and we thought this place maybe a kid friendly environment which it was geared toward kids with the Adventure dome and such. When we arrived first thing out of the car I noticed the awful stench of rotten trash in the over crowded parking structure and figured well that's Vegas baby. Oh no as we waited in line to check in I observed the walks of life this place attracted and the dirt caked on the carpet. In my mind I was thinking this is already not where I wanted to stay, but it was midnight and we needed to get some rest after a 4hr trip turned into 6 hrs. due to a fatal accident on the way in. As our turn came to check in we were greeted by a lady and she looked up our reservation as it was brought up we noticed the charges did not match what we booked. Hotel taxes and room rates were increased only a few dollars but that wasn't the point. The point was it was inaccurate! Well we were tired and just wanted to hit the sack so we paid and were going to deal with the issue at check out. The lady hands us our cards gets a map and write floor 5 and room 099 and directs us on the map how to find the room. So we proceed to follow the instructions. While trying to locate the room carrying bags of luggage and dragging two kids around for a 1/2 hr. we were unsuccessful locating such a room on the 5th floor of 099. Mad as hell as we walked back to the check in I slipped on a flight of stairs that had a plastic edge wearing flip flops and landed flat on my back. Writhing in pain for about 10 Min's. not one person even security walked over to me and asked if I was OK! And yes they saw! Finally making it to check out tired and in pain we asked to speak to the night manager. We explained out situation to him and asked what can he do for us. This guy was a young little punk with and attitude and should never of been put in a position as a manager. He did nothing but offer a extended check out time from 10 a.m. up to 1 p.m. OH YAY GEE thanks! So he resets our room cards and tells us floor 9 and the room number. After 10 Min's. we arrive finally. The room was a standard 2 queen beds and didn't appear all that bad comparable to a Motel 6. \nMorning arrives and is my daughters big day. We hop in the shower and first thing we notice was black mildew all along tub/shower line wall OMG REALLY! I have pictures of this gross and unhealthful environment. In horror and getting out of the shower I grab a bath towel again notice a problem not so much for me but my other half. They only provided 4 bath towels, Zero hand towels and Zero wash cloths. Running down a maid service problem was fixed but the point was these things should of been taken care of before hand. The entire day we were at the competition and visiting around town. We ate dinner at The Garden Grill in the Hotel before we went back to our room. Another horrible experience in itself. We were seated in a booth that the backrest of was loose and coming apart with on the other side a larger man was seated and every time he sat back it popped the backrest approx. 6\"" into my other half's backside violently. So we decided to relocate and mention it to the waitress. After that we heard the words chingada being used as she conversed with another waitress about us. We did not arrive back to the room until midnight and just went to bed. The next morning we packed up and wanted to get out of there. I think with our experiences we were just done with this place and decided to get one last shower before check out. The hell continues as my lady steps out of the shower I hear Oh MY GOD EWWWWWEEEE! I was thinking holy crude what now!!! Yes ladies and gentlemen when you thought this couldn't get worse well it did! She almost stepped on a cockroach getting out of the shower!!! Unbelievable!!! I scooped it up in a cup and wrapped it in the plastic trash bag to take to the check out lady. We finished and went to check out. I calmly handed the lady the plastic bag with the cockroach in it and asked in a very loud voice \""Would you be willing to pay for a room that had these in it\"" She responded by setting the bag in the trash by her desk and said no in a hushed voice. We proceeded to tell her about our problems in detail and show her our photos. We asked what are you willing to do for us? She replied the best we can do for you is credit 1/2 a days stay and all the hotel taxes. Again we were unhappy and were tempted to dispute charges. \nWe promised the kids we would take them to the Adventure Dome for some fun. This is how they get 1 Star! Now this part was geared for kids and have to admit I even had a bit of fun on the rides. We bought a unlimited day pass which was reasonably priced. And have to mention the had some very talented artist where you can get a cartoon, life like portrait hand drawn or a miniature clay face scul"	0
	1219	Tuesday night and the place was humming. The busiest I've ever seen it, which I suspect why it took much longer than usual to to get our drinks and food. The  servers here are the ultimate pros. Had the Caesar salad (w/o anchovies) for the first time; really good and presented differently from the usual.  We each had the Grouper entrees which initially appeared to be a small portion, but I couldn't finish mine. I was accommodated in having my lima beans swapped out for spinach. The grouper was very good. Entree menu is limited, but always well prepared and nicely presented. Finished with the pumpkin souffle which is still decadent. I would give more stars if they had the ability to do a better job with cocktails; no fresh fruit or herbs. The dilemma here is that it's a great wine bar with enormous selections attractively priced. The slowness id being served, without any reassurances form the staff, was another reason they earned only 3 stars.	2
	1220	Customer service is horrible!  I have tried multiple times to give this place another chance and this was the last straw.  Waiting on hold for 8-10 mins is absolutely absurd.  Times before this we had placed big orders only to have them completely screwed up.   If you want real New York style pizza that actually has some flavor behind it then you want to try Due Amici's.	1
	1221	I just came back from a Vegas trip that I take the same time every year. I can't believe how bad this buffet became in 1 year! I should have known when the normally long  lines to get in were gone. Went for dinner. What they called prime rib was not. The shrimp were small and mushy. Some of the items were clearly frozen and defrosted. After filling up on mainly rice and potato since everything else was so bad I thought I would have dessert. Saw a wonderful chocolate cake. First bite and it was obvious it had been there for a few to many days sitting. Dry is a nice word to describe it.	1
	1222	overall the food was OK. the mongolian beef was good, kung pow chicken ok, roasted chicken, good flavoring but very very dry. HOWEVER both times they messed up my order (butchered) never gave me 4 of the soups i was supposed to get and gave me the wrong sides multiple times. (after telling them multiple times) there completely incompetent. i can see what others meant by the servers being rude....\non the food note again, the pork fried rice both times was complete mush and unedible, just absolutely vile. the eggrolls were a gressy uneatable soggy flavorless mess.	1
	1223	okay for a stop with the guys for a beer. I would not take my girlfriend there as the bartenders would not impress a date.  smoking patio is good.  tvs good. Not my favorite for food.	2
	1224	I ate here twice while in Vegas. Hubby was down for the count due to too much partying. We were looking for some rice, noodles, or soup for him. We found Dragon Noodle in our hotel and decided to check it out.\n\nMom and I shared a seafood noodle dish that had tons of shellfish but kind of a gross, bland sauce. We also got some veggie spring rolls which were perfectly greasy and yummy. We also had some wonton soup- delish!\n\nI think hubby liked his fried rice but couldn't really tell as he was basically comatose :).\n\nWe also went there to get sushi and the California rolls had big chunks of crab in them- not yucky crab salad.\n\nThis place was good- not great- but will suffice when you want greasy carbs to coat your stomach after- or before- a hard night of, well, Vegas-ing!	2
	1225	"I have never met more rude pit bosses then I have at this place. Holy hell.\n\nWe came over from Planet Hollywood because they told us this was their \""sister\"" hotel and they had $10 tables or would open one up for our large group. The pit boss, whose name I can't remember-It was Lita or something like that refused to do so. Then there was a male pit boss who was pretty much making fun of us because we said there was $100 minimum table and no one was sitting at it. We told him it would make more sense for him to have 6 of us sitting there gambling at $10 then have it be empty. He said \""what about that table? Do you want to gamble $100 a hand? If so, sit down. If not, sorry\"". I asked him if he was getting paid to be an asshole and left.\n\nGet it together."	0
	1226	This was our first time staying here and were very pleased. The staff was really friendly and our room was spacious and very clean. The AM complimentary breakfast was also very good and once again a super friendly staff.	3
	1227	If you're in the mood to walk around, shop and eat this is your place. Great stores to look at it with a small town feel. Awesome place to check out if you are not from the area.	3
	1228	I had high hopes for this place since I have visited here before. \n\nI ordered the taco salad with chicken. When it came out the cheese looked un appetizing, The tortilla bowl they served my guac and sour cream in was already soaking from the chicken juice. The salad was warm and soggy. \n\nI also had to get up to ask for more water after she had stopped by to see how everyone was doing drink wise. \n\nHopefully this can be improved. I will not be ordering this dish again.	1
	1229	I think the store is okay. It is my last resort when it comes to my go to store. If i need something on my way home ill stop therd\nbut i really am giving 5 stars to the pharmacy for thier work they do. I love the pharm tech kevin and also the two pharmacists that work there!	2
	1230	I would have given this place 5-stars but ever since they switched to AYCE...the quality has gone down. I used to love having their Tonkatsu Roll with calamari in the middle instead of shrimp but now they don't have it. The menu has cut down A LOT and it's very disappointing cause I was a loyal customer. \n\nI preferred this place over Oyshi Sushi but now it seems Oyshi has overtaken it.	2
	1231	The  little crown is just as fun as the big one and a lot less crowded!  The old man and I are found there during football (soccer) season watching the games and hangin' with other locals.  Carlos is the best bartender EVER and quiz night is a ton of fun!!!	4
	1232	My wife and I make this place a habit. Never once in our 10+ visits have we experienced any of the negative things mentioned in lesser reviews. \nWe are willing to drive from Gilbert to Shea and the 101 to eat/drink at a restaurant where we know that the Chefs, business partners and servers put real passion into what they do. \nThere are not many restaurants where, on a Sunday afternoon you see a head chef in the trenches not just making amazing food but also bussing tables alongside his business partner. \nWe make the hike up to paradise valley every week for bomb nachos/tacos/dessert, awesome drinks and hospitable service from Victoria, Riley, Payton, Dave and the entire crew. These guys kill it and if you haven't tried it, try it, you won't regret it.	4
	1233	I liked the decor and its location but for the price you should go to Quiznos. The sandwich was okay, nothing special. Place was dead on a Sunday for sure! Perhaps if the food wasn't so small for the price it would be better.	1
	1234	I got the pork chipotle and my wife got the smoked chicken enchilada. Mine was good, hers was great!	3
	1235	I wish I would have pissed away the money I paid for tickets on gambling!	0
	1236	Someone had told me that I had to check this place out for the coffee, espresso, and mocha things.  Well, the coffee didn't really impress me all that much. I had gotten a mocha and my friend got a latte. It definitely had enough caffeine but just wasn't that good. I tried my friend's latte and it wasn't that great either. Customer service was alright. The girl working was pretty nice. \n\nI didn't try any of the pastries which i probably should of but on the coffee itself I give 2 stars. If I come back here I'll update this.	1
	1237	We were interested in learning more about several different kinds of birds because we have been looking in to purchasing one.  We went to Cage World in Mesa and I was very impressed.  The reps there were very friendly.  I had my four young children with me, and the moment we walked in the door, one of the representatives walked over to us and asked my son if he'd like to hold one of the birds.  He helped my son feel comfortable holding one, even though he's never been around birds before.  \n\nI found the staff to be very knowledgable about the care and background of these birds.  They were super friendly and didn't mind at all answering the long list of questions I had.  \n\nI didn't purchase a bird at that time as I wanted to do some more research first.  I have found that Cage World is quite pricey, but because of their service and expertise, if I do end up adding a bird to our family I could do worse than getting it from here.	4
	1238	"I'm a fan of Chuck's TV personality but didn't have too-high expectations about this place. And even still, it certainly did disappoint! (Then again, it could have just been a general letdown after the euphoria of eating at Au Pied Du Cochon the night before... but more on that in another review). Anyway, let's start with the atmosphere: we had the earliest reservation available (5:30pm; not by choice) and felt like we were intruding on a casual hangout. One of the servers was DJing via laptop behind the bar. I'm usually not this critical but come on, this is an \""exclusive\"" restaurant, have a damn soundtrack or at least surf YouTube somewhere you can't be seen. The other thing  - the bartender told us the cocktail specials - one was something with a vodka base; behind her were varied top-shelf vodkas. We were sitting at the bar so we saw her make the actual cocktail, and it was made with Smirnoff. Not a classy move, guys. Hide that stuff if you're gonna do it.\n\nOnto the food. It just wasn't very good. Tasted fresh enough, but not special or delicious by any means. The lobster poutine had like half a piece of lobster on it. We got the smaller portion and she said it wouldn't have big pieces, but it barely had ANY pieces. And the broth didn't taste very rich or lobstery either - it wasn't even salty enough. The mushroom tart we got tasted fresh but BLAND. Really bland. The bison tartare was quite good. That's all we had. The desserts didn't sound very appetizing.\n\nWhat a disappointment -- not to mention that this place is located in the horse-smelling touristy \""old\"" village. Avoid it."	1
	1239	Can I just say that giving star ratings gives me headaches? Like I don't know how many stars they deserve! There should be like an alternative rating.. Like love it, like it, gotta try it?! Lol\n\nI'm not sure what happened, but I'm going to have to say that my friends over hyped this place for me. I went with my friend Ryan, and let me tell you know that Ryan is very particular with food. He's a hospitality major, so customer service is also on Ryan's priority list. \n\nTacos were okay. Don't get al pastor/adobada. Don't waste your time. It's nasty. A good side was that there carnitas is on point. Try it on a mula (quesadilla like with extra goodies inside and your choice of meat!) $4 but pretty tasty. \n\nOkay.. Biggest disappointment.. The vampiro. It was supposed to be the deal breaker from the recommendations I got. Yeah, no. Totally burnt tasting. Why? Cause they burnt it! \n\nRyan and I were thinking.. Maybe it was an off day..? But then we thought, tacos el Gordo doesn't have off days. So we decided it was their fault, in which it rightly is. \n\nOh, the salsa bar is pretty sweet. One problem. No labels. Thanks for the mystery taste adventure, but if someone is allergic to one of those sauces .. It won't look good later... Unless you're bored or don't have enough gas to get to tacos el Gordo.. Then walk or take the bus.. Skip this place if possible!	2
	1240	Love this place.  All the work is done on site and they have the machines to dry clean large items like comforters.  They also do on site alterations.	2
	1241	"I am glad I waited until I had 2 experiences at Hakkasan to write my review as opposed to writing it after my first experience. \n\nIt is very small. You are constantly pushing through people. There are a lot of stairs too, that are really dangerous when you're even the slightest bit drunk in heels. \n\nThe first time, we went on a Thursday and it turned out bad. It seemed like the crowd that night were all older people. Supposedly, I ended up getting into a fight with an older Caucasian male because someone pushed me and I bumped into his arm causing him to spill his drink on me and him. It got so bad that he came looking for me after I boldly told him to \""shut the f*ck up,\"" and then I had to push him out of my face. I ended up only staying until about 1:00 because I was so pissed. After that night I told my boyfriend I never want to go back because it's way too small and the crowd there is not ideal for a good time. \n\nThe second time, we went on a Sunday for Tiesto and it was awesome. The crowd was better and of course, since Tiesto was there, it made a huge difference.  Their lighting is pretty decent but not the best. \n\nA lot I reviews say the bouncers are a-holes but I completely disagree. A lot of them help you down the hundreds of stairs and there is one bouncer, kind of older guy with a shaved head and glasses, who led us to a spot on the stars RIGHT in front of Tiesto and let us stay there the entire night. He even offered us mints. I wish I had heard him when he told us his name cause I would give him a huge shoutout. He's pretty much the reason I ended up having an awesome 2nd experience at Hakkasan. \n \nDrinks are expensive but it's Vegas. You don't go to a Vegas club and expect to only pay $8 a drink. But to make up for the fact that a drink is almost $20, they basically give you a double shot. \n\nOverall, yes I would visit this club again but not on a Thursday and only if a good DJ is playing."	3
	1242	Rude customer service , microwaved food , Owners will tell you to your face there not interested if they dont wanna accommodate your needs that day. \n\nThey keep moving locations probably because they have worn down there welcome in the community everywhere they go .. 3 different locations in 5 years .	0
	1243	The food is ok, don't go unless you are really hungry. They do partner with the pizza resturant next door, which is yummy! We usually only go to watch the UFC fights, normally the drinks are decent, but this past saturday they were completely watered down. I don't know how you can mess up a Long Island Ice tea, or a cosmo.  We asked the waitress if the manager could have the bartender remake the drinks, he had a standoff attitude, stating the long island is premade so it should always taste the same and he couldn't do anything. The waitress gave me another cosmo but I refused the drink , he only gave it to me because I told him nevermind we will just drink our $9.00 glass of water. The prices for bowling are ridiculous, the food is mediocre, the staff are young and if they are older adults this atmoshphere isn't a place to attend if you are sober. It's a waste of your time. The epicentre can do better.	1
	1244	I only had a spider roll and dragon roll so I can't comment beyond that. I was impressed the food tasted great, had large portions, and service was fast and friendly. I will definitely come back next time I stay at Luxor so I can try more. Prices were high but that's Vegas.	3
	1245	First of all, I'm very excited that all these new places are opening in Homestead! I'm so excited to try them all. Recently my husband and I ventured to Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace on a down night. The restaurant only opened in November. We'd read the reviews the restaurant had gotten already and figured it was worth a try.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is really nice. Brick walls with a steel mill theme. There's even a guide to warning whistles behind the bar. There's also a gorgeous chandelier in the entrance. The space has two levels, although they're currently only serving on one. I'm guessing as they begin to get more service they'll expand to the second level. \n\nWe got the jalapeno pirogies as an appetizer. They were delicious. I'm not even a HUG pirogie fan. I usually find them to be a little too buttery/greasy...but these were perfect. They still had that comfort food deliciousness but weren't laden with butter.\n\nFor dinner I had the meatball sandwich. It was very good. The meatballs are actually stuffed with cheese and spices, and I really enjoyed the marinara they use on the sandwich. All sandwiches come with steak fries. They're on the softer side, which I like but I know a lot of people aren't big fans of. My husband got the steak. He said it was good, but he could tell it had been sitting for awhile.\n\nIt did take us a little longer than expected to be served our entrees...almost an hour (reason for 3 stars instead of 4). You can definitely tell they're a new restaurant when it comes to service. Everyone is very nice, but it seems they aren't up par yet as far as checking on tables and getting meals out. However I know these are growing pains that come with opening up a new place. \n\nThe food definitely makes this place worth the visit. I'm looking forward to stopping back in the future once they've established themselves a bit more.	2
	1246	I've never eaten in at Crandall's, only ordered from them via grubhub.com, so that's what I'm reviewing. The food is fine, but they have no idea what they're doing at the restaurant. I've ordered from them three times and will never order from them again. The first time I ordered from Crandall's, I realized that I had entered the wrong address in grubhub so I called the restaurant to let them know. They had no idea what grubhub was and insisted on rudely telling me I had the wrong restaurant. The second time I ordered from them, I got a call - after an hour of waiting for the food - saying that they were out of what I had ordered. The third time, they packaged my order wrong and I received the wrong food. When I called to ask them to send me the correct order, they insisted it was the delivery guy's fault. I have no idea what goes on at that restaurant, but it is terribly run. I've never had such bad service. I've never written a Yelp review before, but I'm so annoyed with them that I felt it merited a review.	1
	1247	I recently read that the Pin Up Shows contract was extended another year.  What is Statosphere thinking.  All I can say is...someone must be paying Statosphere to run this terrible show....do Not waste your time or money.	0
	1248	I love this place. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of the price. $30 a person plus tip is the most i have ever spent on a buffet. It is worth it though. The food quality is great along with obviously the choices. I used to come here more when the prices were lower. Now i only come here when i come with some one who hasnt been here before. There aren't many good buffets in vegas. Just mediocre	3
	1249	How a place can change in two years! Two years ago we had so much fun at Rhumbar we planned a return experience. This time - not so much. We arrived immediately after the first showing of Cirque de Soleil - LOVE let out. We were to meet friends at Rhumbar and start our evening out on the town. The hostess wasn't the nicest, especially when I asked to sit in a different area than she wanted to seat me. Then when the server came over to take our drink order, she let us know there was a $24 minimum - ah, fine, do we look like we can't afford $24? Why did she have a need to tell us this fact? My husband was smoking a cigar and enjoying the view as we ordered our drinks. Our friends arrived and the DJ started spinning SO LOUD we couldn't even talk to each other! Also, the DJ wasn't all that. We ended up closing our tab and leaving much quicker than we planned because it was just too loud. Unfortunately, we could not get our server's attention to close out the bill - and I had to get up and find her and tell her so. Horrible service. GONG.	1
	1250	"Rockin Rita's tries to be a down home type of place but some of it's novelties make my stomach churn with uneasiness. When I was sifting through the menu I saw pictures of little mini toilet bowls filled with Chili and blue alcoholic beverages. I'm sure they thought this was clever but it just conjures up images I don't want to think about before I eat.\n\nMy cousin and I ordered the ribs which was about $22.00. When it came out mine was okay but it wasn't \""fall off the bone terrific\"". My cousin's was tougher my husband even had a hard time cutting into it. The waiter came by and asked how the food was. My cousin says, \""Do you really want to know\""? The waiter cautiously says, \""Yes\"". \""I'm not a complainer but these are the worst ribs I have ever had in my life.\"" Just for the record my cousin is a complainer LOL but she had a point. The customer service here is really good that is why I gave them three stars instead of two. They were nice and offered her another menu item to replace the ribs and they removed her ribs off the bill. She ordered a medium rare burger which came out really rare. It just looked like they seared both sides of the burger. Most of it was red so my cousin didn't really eat it but was tired of complaining. I didn't  finish my ribs either they made me queasy.  I had a bite of my husband's jalapeno burger and I wished I ordered that instead. My brother loved the junkyard dog. He said I wouldn't like it though because it was salty. My brother and husband ordered a krispy creme sundae.  I had a bite it was a little too sweet for me.\n\nOverall the food is a hit or miss but the customer service here was really top notch!"	2
	1251	Awful experience constantly haunts me. I purchased my 08 Sti there 2 years ago at 22k miles. 3 months later the engine blew because they sold me a car with cracked piston rings and an ecu that had a recall on it that should have been reflashed before they sold it to me. They admitted they made the mistake decided to replace the engine while trying to get me to replace my clutch at another $1500 charge. Brandi the girl working service at the time told me the clutch only had 3 months left on it. 2 1/2 years later still do not need a clutch. Right after they installed the new engine the turbo blew because they did not install it properly so I had to go another week driving there POS loner car. Now my electrical system goes out from time to time. No stereo no clock, nothing! Just comes on whenever it feels like it. Good thing I bought a warranty for a certified used subaru, right? Wrong! Assholes Mark the salesman who has no idea what he is doing an Fat Vinny the finance manager lied right to my face saying it was a certified used car and that i had a new car warranty of 36k miles after the 22k the car already had. Took it in yesterday and Gary the service director tells me to fuck off because my paperwork only shows a classic used car warranty and not the certified warranty mark and Vinny promised! What a surprise! Iv purchased all my cars since I was 16 from Findlay and will no longer being doing so. DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THESE PEOPLE. They are liars and thieves! And I didn't even mention the lemon 2010 mini I bought the same week as the subaru that cost us $4k 6 months after we bought it.......	0
	1252	This place sucked! We went cause hash house but they closed, this place was open so we'd try it, nah, never again I can't even wright a review	0
	1253	I bought a Groupon for 3 car washes. Each of these washes is normally worth $10. I got my first one today and wish I hadn't bought the Groupon. I'm giving this place 2 stars because the wash did get most of the dirt off my car (my car wasn't especially dirty though), the staff was nice, and no damage was done.  However, I am not pleased with the job done. My two main complaints are that my car was still very wet after the wash, and more annoyingly, there was a significant amount of soap on my car's trunk. \n\nI much prefer the car wash place near the corner of McClintock and University not that far away. For even cheaper they get all the soap off and make sure the car is dry by having people wipe it down for you. They too have free vacuums.	1
	1254	I have yet to be disappointed with this place!  This is a great new bar in Phoenix!    Happy hour is never a disappointment and the drinks are awesome!  The Pom is my favorite drink and it comes with a kick!  I haven't found an item on the menu I haven't liked.  I've had a little bit of everything on the menu.  The nachos are my favorite with the homemade chips.  The grill cheese was my best pick for dinner.  Bacon and pears was a fantastic addition to this sandwich.  Pair this sandwich with the sea salt & vinegar shoestring fries to complete the dish.  I can't wait to go back to try the Mac & Cheese.  This place has it all: great food, great drinks and an awesome atmosphere!	4
	1255	i have worked with D&R to purchase a gold bracelet for a man.  They worked within my price range and found me a beautiful bracelet. The recipient was very pleased with it.  Rich and Dave are very good to work with and I do plan on using them for all my jewelry needs.	4
	1256	I needed my sushi fix and didn't want to leave the house. So I had my girl pull out her trusty Yelp app and find a place that would deliver. I went a little crazy and ordered way more than we needed. The food came quickly and was ok. It was no Goyemon, but it was good for what it was. I'd order from them again.	3
	1257	"First off, if anyone reading this gets offended, please be aware that as an American, I do in fact have the right to an opinion. I don't want to get shot!\n\nI support the Democratic party, but since my red state dad was in town, i thought it might be interesting to take him to the gun show. i am a gun owner but the thought of being around several thousand other gun owners made me a bit nervous. \n\nit's kind of a rip-off. 7 bucks to park, 16 bucks to get in the place. and then everything in there is mostly over priced. it is kind of a nightmare for a liberal like me....the things overheard should make the owners of those comments ashamed of themselves. race, religion, sex...i overhead every kind of hateful thing said about every other race, religion, sex, etc. and to top it off, even my father...a gun-totin, conservative republican said to me as we were leaving \""Well, i can see why most people shouldn't own guns\"". one of the scariest things i overheard from a vendor was this: a young man walks up to one of the sellers of guns. the young man says \""So what's your background and paperwork requirements?\"". the gun seller says \""how about cash?\"" and that was it. a semi-automatic AR-15 was sold. \nthere was a line for ammunition about 3 hours long. people seem to be really scared about their guns and ammo getting taken away. this happens every 5 years or so. \n\nin any case, an excellent place for mullet spotting, but i wouldn't go back and would advise anyone with any sense to avoid it as well."	0
	1258	Just the basics... no joke.  This place lives up to it's name.  I would imagine this is what's served at the farmer's table for breakfast.  Thick sausage... nice bacon... awesome pancakes... and most of all, great service!  I love it when I can walk into a local joint and get great service!\n\nNot to mention it's fantastically cheap... weekend menu's are dig-change-outta the sofa cheap.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you're in this area!	4
	1259	Vielleicht habe ich nur einen schlechten Tag erwischt.\nDas Lokal ist nicht ganz voll, das Ambiente mediterran ansprechend und das Servicepersonal emsig.\nDie Karte liest sich, wie die Wochenempfehlungen vielversprechend.\nIch w\u00e4hle die Fischsuppe a la carte, die auf Nachfrage zwar nicht gebunden, aber legiert sein soll und Tagliatelle mit Steinpilzen -was selbstredend ist.\nDie Wartezeiten sind angemessen, was dann kommt entspricht jedoch nicht den Erwartungen.\nF\u00fcr die ann\u00e4hernd klare, geschmacklich zur\u00fcckhaltende Fischsuppe wurde gerade mal Lachs, Pulpo und Scampis verarbeitet, kein weiterer Fisch oder Miesmuscheln.\nDie Tagliatelle zu den Steinpilzen sind jenseits von al dente und neben den fachgerecht sautierten Steinpilzen findet man weitere Pilze, die in Konsistenz, Farbe und Geschmack nichts mit den \u00fcbrigen Steinpilzen des Gerichtes gemeinsam haben.\nDie Reklamation wird in der K\u00fcche vorgetragen und zur Demonstration sogar der Korb mit den Steinpilzen, die ausschlie\u00dflich verarbeitet sein sollen, mit an den Tisch gebracht.\nGern will ich es glauben, gerade wenn man bem\u00fcht ist, so auf den Gast einzugehen, aber gerade bei Pilzgerichten darf f\u00fcr mich kein Zweifel bleiben. \nTrotzdem werde ich dem Veritas eine zweite Chance geben.	2
	1260	If I could give this place a 0 star review I would. I'm livid. I have gone to sushi too multiple times, both in the restaurant and delivery. I will say the food is great. I just made a delivery order (for the 3rd time since i moved to Pittsburgh in November) and then was called an HOUR after I made the order and told that my order will not be delivered due to the fact that they do not feel safe driving in my neighborhood. I live in East Liberty, a 5 min drive from Shady Side. The part that I am confused about is that they have delivered to me multiple times before, in this neighborhood and now are refusing to. \n\nIf they didn't feel comfortable delivering to me I would have understood if they called 5 min after the order to inform me but they called an HOUR after the order was placed. On top of it they told me to come pick up the food, but would not offer any sort of compensation! \n\nHORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!	0
	1261	Not very happy after tonight's visit... Food was undercooked for both of us and we ended up having to pay full price for bottle of wine because apparently if you have a Groupon (which doesn't even cover alcohol) they penalize you for having it. Tonight's dinner ended up costing more than our norm. Really unhappy and we were regulars so I'm not sure that we will return.	1
	1262	quick note.. i'm not really into buffets.. i prefer quality over quantity.. and this buffet just wasn't very good.. \n\nalthough it wasn't very busy.. it took at least 15 minutes to get seated.. there was a decent selection of food.. nothing really stood out... nothing was truly awful..	1
	1263	Holy BLEH! Batman. The bad: artichoke hearts, eggs Benedict, pancakes, and bacon ordered crispy came out very soft and the server.  \n\nYou can see my pic for the Benny.  \u00dcber runny egg with lots of water trapped in it, whites not completely cooked. The other was almost cooked enough, so I only ate one.\n\nThe pancakes weren't cooked all the way through and were gummy on the inside. \n\nThe artichoke hearts were greasy, super chewy and really lacked flavor. \n\nOrder crispy bacon and it came out soggy and very salty. \n\nAt one point we went to the soda kiosk to refill our sodas as our waitress was in attentive. After the food arrived she was MIA. \n\nSeriously, it pisses me off that I work hard for my money, but these people work half-assed to take it.	0
	1264	"It had been many years since we had been to Los Sombreros, as we usually end up at Frank and Lupes's if we are this close to Old Town. Now, the first issue is the style of the food: some people do not consider ANY kind of Mexican food to be \""gourmet\"" or worth any combo plate being more than $8.95.I grew up on Mexican food, and it's changed to include other areas of Mexico - the seafood of the Yucatan, the European influence of Oaxaca. It's not \""fusion\""....it's all Mexico, but most of us have had limited exposure to what Mexican food can really do!\nWe arrived early on a Saturday and settled in on the patio - prettier than I remember and furnished nicely. We were immediately welcomed and escorted to a table. They could really use a guitarist on nice evenings. We ordered the Huitlacoche Crepas after I read the reviews here on Yelp. They were in-cred-i-ble with the earthiness of the mushroom-like fungus (sorry, I couldn't come up with a better word), the sweetness of the corn, and the compatible contrast of the cheese and a drizzle of pomagranet sauce. I don't know why a previous reviewer posted regarding the crepes being too sweet, as the sauce was not overly plentiful, and I would not have liked the dish to be swimming in the sweet sauce either. My husband had the carnitas which were wonderfully lean and smoky. However, when he tasted my Smoked Chicken Enchiladas, he absolutely rolled his eyes in ecstasy. Normally, I might have avoided a Tomatillo sauce, as it can be too bright and citrus-y, but this was just a blend of flavors that made me utter continual \""Mmmmmmmm's\"" with every bite, and although I could have finished the plate, I left just enough to enjoy for a small lunch the next day. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!! With drinks (3), appetizer, 2 Entrees, tip - the bill was about $100, and worth it. We will be back soon.\n2nd review - April, 2012  - I have removed a star. The hostess was rude, seating on the front patio is horrendous.....noise, the smell of the street, and the table in the corner sits at such a slant that you have to hold on to your drink. We introduced new Scottsdale residents to the restaurant that night, and they wished we had taken them back to Frank and Lupe's. So, Los Sombreros needs to prioritize consistency  - which probably isn't going to happen in such a small space"	2
	1265	"Don't shoot the reviewer but I wasn't that impressed with Pinky's.  It wasn't a bad experience but it wasn't fantastic.  First, I can see why Pinky's had to place a car on their roof, there is just nowhere to park your damn car!  Thankfully, we noticed a sign that pointed to a lot across the street for Pinky's patrons.  Once we got in, it was slammed; however, duly noted is its small size, so slammed is relative. In any case, we got a small bar top table just big enough for 2 people.  The weird thing is that we literally had about 4 different servers.  I think it was technically a \""pick-up\"" table (for those of you who serve) but a waitress came over, and then a bartender, and then another bartender, and then a different waitress.  I really have no idea what was going on. The plus is that we never needed to ask for refills!  The menu, in theory, looked amazing.  I love the cool titles and the unique items offered.  Who can't laugh at a \""Weiner Wonderland\"" section?  I just found my food to be mediocre.  Everything seemed very fried.  It was almost an artery overload that made me feel a bit nauseous.  I have mixed feelings about returning but will be open to reading future reviews that may change my mind!"	2
	1266	One of my favorite local dive bars.  Drinks are cheap and the shuffleboard is free.  We have been here numorous times with a small group and never had a problem finding a place to sit.  \n\nOne of the cool things about  this place is I work graveyard shift and I can come here @ 6am to get a frosty cold adult beverage after a long night of work.	4
	1267	"Before I delve into my personal experience at Hiro, I will discuss the important factors of, what makes a good sushi restaurant, according to my criteria. \n\nFor credibility I've eaten sushi my entire life, everywhere from Cali to Vegas to Thailand. I believe I can distinguish between the different levels of quality in regards to sushi grade fish. \n\n- Fish Quality \n   I ordered the dinner sashimi platter ($21), 2 orders of the spanish mackeral nigiri($11), 1 order of the giant clam nigiri ($11). \n             *The sashimi was average, and the tuna had a distinct \""fishy\"" smell to it. The portions were of average size, and the layout was aesthetically pleasing. The Spanish Mackeral was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD! I highly recommend it, albeit the cuts are small, the fish is delicious. The giant clam was overpriced based on its size and freshness. \n\n- Rice Quality\n    This is pretty hard to mess up. The rice is perfectly balanced as it should be. The fish to rice ratio was good. \n\nI went into this restaurant with high expectations, first from the high reviews on Yelp, and second upon entering the restaurant you are overwhelmed by an abundance of Japanese celebrity pictures plastered all throughout the entrance. They are all somehow affiliated with the restaurant/owner. The pictures suggest that these Japanese celebrities have eaten at this restaurant and give their thumb of approval. \n\n3 stars because this restaurant, in regards to nigiri and sashimi, were just average. The problem with sushi reviews on Yelp is that you get a lot of \""reviewers\"" talking about rolls and sake bombers. It's sad but true that so many people will judge a restaurant based on how good their rolls are when the true judgment of a sushi restaurant should be in the quality of their fish. \n\nThe sushi reviews on this restaurant and others here in phoenix are skewed, because restaurants accommodate too much to their target audience, and unfortunately their target audience does not include me. \n\nThe phoenix sushi market is tailored towards the \""noobies\"" of sushi, this trend in phoenix has led to inaccurate reviews of restaurants.\n\nWho cares about how much mayonnaise, sriracha, imitation crab, and fried stuff a place can put in a roll, lets talk about the good stuff, the stuff that people crave. \n\nI have given up on sushi in Phoenix, from now on I will get my sushi fix from Cali, Vegas, or Seattle. You can't go wrong with these places, the sushi is tailored towards sashimi connoisseurs and true sushi fanatics. \n\nIt's unfortunate but Phoenix is a noob city when it comes to sushi."	2
	1268	Took my mom for her birthday tonight. Just moved here from nyc. I'm a great critic and a food expert ;) \nOmg. Mom loved the seabass!!! I loved the strip steak . It was hugeeeee. Cooked perfect !! I shared it with my wife. All salads. Sides and dishes are like family style ..nice portions! Worth every penny. Best meal I think we ever had. The apple walnut salad yum! Ramone was our waiter' he was a perfect gentlemen. Very friendly and professional . Had us cut into steak to make sure up to pay prior to biting. They gave us a free vanilla ice cream and brownie cake in honor of mom's birthday which was awesome.i am going back!! I loved everything from the casual yet romantic setting to the bread, meal and coffee! It was perfect! Goooooo	4
	1269	After hearing a lot of great things about this place, I wasn't particularly impressed by it. I managed to get a reservation for 4 on a Wednesday at 7:30pm by calling the day before. \n\nThough we were excited to finally get to try Nora Gray, the majority of the dishes weren't particularly impressive. My halibut was served on a bed of lentils and was minimally seasoned to allow the natural flavours of the fish to shine through, but it wasn't particularly mind-blowing. In particular, my friends weren't particularly impressed with their rabbit parmesan, noting that the heavy cheese and sauce completely overshadowed the meat. That said, their gnocchi was pretty amazing, having been cooked well with just the right amount of creaminess. I probably would've been happier with a full order of this for myself.\n\nService-wise, the wait-time between courses was quite lengthy. However, the servers were thoughtful enough to continue refilling our waters as the long, idle periods meant a lot of thoughtless water-drinking. \n\nOverall, perhaps I'm not giving Nora Gray enough credit where credit's due, but this seemed to be another instance in which hype overshadowed my experience at a popular restaurant. Parenthetically, a highlight of the night was spotting Chris North (of Sex and the City fame) dining at a table not too far away from us. Guess we're in good company, at least.	2
	1270	The corner is such a cute space\nWe arrived a little after 6:00pm and there were already sooooo many Yelpers\nIt was amazing... The music was on point...\nIt was great to see so many people in their ugly sweaters... Mine was a total last minute idea but I'm glad no one said anything about it haha \nPerhaps it wasn't ugly enough\nThe young lady at the sign in table was very nice and informed us about signing in, free tchotchkes, and omg... I totally left my white elephant gift at home...\nBoooooo...\nI was really glad to receive free ice skating vouchers, those will come in handy when I'm feeling like\nKristy Yamaguchi...\n\nThe food layout was a little all over the place but it allowed us to walk around and mingle...\nI really enjoyed all of the bites and I fell in love with the cherry vanilla porter from Flagstaff... That was really good... The cookie decorating area was a nice touch, the lady who made the cookies was super nice and omg, the cookies were divine... I'm currently laying in bed eating the last piece and wishing I made 10+ to last me another hour...\n\n\nI was sad when I couldn't partake in the white elephant gift exchange so I guess someone in my friends/family circle will be receiving a potato pellet shooting gun thingy... \n\nIt was a fun night \nThank you to Lindsey for putting on a successful event and Congrats on your baby girl	4
	1271	Having a gold membership makes everything so simple. You get to skip the lines and walk directly to the garage and pick up your car without any hassle. The price is good too. I paid a total of $80 to rent a Camry from Friday-Monday.	4
	1272	The food portions are way oversized, but a great value for the price charged. The average person will be able to get two meals out of the order if they want to take a box home with them. In my opinion, the food quality does not deserve a ranking higher than 3 stars. It is good solid and well made, but it is not knock your socks off outstanding. The thing that makes it stand out is the portions - that WILL knock your socks off.	2
	1273	Houston's, but with a less extensive menu...that's what people say about this place.\n\nAnd they are right...to an extent...so that probably explains why I actually like the place:)\n\nThe Beautiful Carin and I wandered over for dinner the other evening (as you can see, I am a little bit behind on writing my little review-like stories:)\n\nWe have been a number of times over the years because when you live in Old Town Scottsdale, Bandera is:\n\n* Close\n* Pretty Decent Food\n* Close\n* Pretty Good Martinis\n* Close\n\nWe generally go to Bandera in the summer and fall when the crowds are gone and they seem almost pathetically happy to see us walk through the door:)\n\nI do enjoy the corn bread...like corny, bready candy:)\n\nAnd the martini's are big and chock full of vitamin V (and priced somewhat less than the marti's at AZ88:)\n\nThe food has always been good, the short ribs, the rotisserie chicken, the prime rib...you know, just good, solid, all-american fare:)\n\nBandera is probably nothing you'd go out of your way for, and certainly nothing that I would queue up for a 90 minute wait for (during the winter months), but worth the stroll over this time of year:)\n\nSo, if you're in Old Town and looking for corn bread, braised short ribs and an ice cold vodka marti, stop in and see the folks at Houstera...I mean Bandston's...oh, you know what I mean:	3
	1274	If I could make it zero star's, I would. These people are the rudest idiots I have ever dealt with. They will send you a bill for no reason after your insurance company has already paid for everything. Please read all the reviews about this place on the all the various sites, and you will see a trend of bad service and incompetent Dr's.  Stay away from them and go anywhere else to get your care.	0
	1275	"Would most likely be 2 if we didn't have such nice servers.  And might have had more stars if there was some sort of atmosphere here.  The Disclaimer: We were staying at the hotel and didn't want to venture out.  This seemed to be a good option.\n\nWe had reservations at 8pm on a Friday night.  Earlier that day we had received a call to confirm our reservation because it \""get's very busy, and they wanted to be sure we would be coming in\"".  When we arrive, we found that we were 1 of 2 couples in the entire place.  Wha??  It IS Friday night, right?  Where is everyone?  Apparently, at the Frankie Avalon concert that started at 7pm - we just missed the rush.  So....it is THAT kind of crowd here.  \n\nWhile I was excited to have the teppanyaki table to ourselves, the prices were a little too rich for my tastes.  $48 for steak and shrimp meal seemed a little steep.  And I've seen that show too many times to get excited about it, so I didn't want to \""pay\"" for the experience.  We moved to a regular table.\n\nThe other big thing here - None of their menus are correct.  They give you 3 when you sit down.  We ordered Gyoza ( listed on the menu available in chicken and shrimp) and we were asked if pork was ok. That was all they had.  While not actually listed on the menu, but on Opentable (and Yelp), they only serve Beer & Wine.  And my wine was listed at 2 different prices depending on what menu I read.  As we continued to find little errors like that our waitress just laughed and apologized.  She knew how ridiculous this was becoming.\n\nOtherwise, the food was good and the service was good.  There was no vibe, no other people and no attention to detail on the menu.  And, there is outside seating - despite what you read.  However, I would likely not come back since there are definitely other places with a better atmosphere."	2
	1276	We order lunch every day for the office, and someone always goes out and picks it up.\n\nOrdered Skillets today, and they added an 18% gratuity to a large take-out order. Refused to take the tip off when confronted about it.\n\nWe will never be going back.	0
	1277	"if you've been to this location when it was Old Chicago, it hasn't changed much.\n\nabsolutely same decor, same uber selection of beers on tap and in the bottle - they even play bad 90's rock too loud on the jukebox in the bar still. i don't even think they changed the menu...yep, they still serve up their signature italian nachos...\n\nfor as college-y sports fan as it kind of seems to be targeted for, it's a pretty normal crowd, like really normal, forgettably normal, and i don't mean that in a crappy way. i used to live right down the way and the roommates and i would head up for a beer or two, reasonably priced bar food (mushroom swiss burgers, pizzas, calzones, appetizers, decent salads). i hate to compare it to an applebee's or friday's, but i guess if i had to, i would- but you don't leave with that corporate whoreing out  feeling.\n\nthe bar seating area is plentiful, it's a upbeat atmosphere with consistently decent-to-good service. it's the kind of place you could even take your dad or your coworkers, too. and when i finally say fuck it to \""if it's too loud you're too old\"" and ask the server to turn down the juke box, they do."	2
	1278	I loved this place! Tried pok belly for the first time, I could eat that til the day I die. The veal porterhouse was amazing. I had the pecan crusted venison....loved. However, our server was less than tolerant of my friend who was 84 years old. He normally tips 40 to 50 percent. He got 20 percent and was lucky.	4
	1279	Think they can't ruin a burger?! Think again.  Plus they have the audacity to charge an automatic 11% for TIP!!!!  Service SUCKED, beer SUCKED, burgers SUCKED - need I say more - don't waste your time - grab anything elsewhere - anywhere!	0
	1280	"It kills me to write this review. This is maybe the most disappointing dining experience I've ever had in Las Vegas. I brought a group of 11 here last Thursday night. Our waiter's name was Bobby. He strongly suggested a pre-fixe menu due to the size of our party - it would come with appetizers, main dishes and dessert for $60 a person (pre-fixe means we have no choice in what gets brought to out table, FYI).\n\nSo after we agree to the dinner, the appetizers made it out in about 20 minutes; and honestly, they were great. Fried pork buns, spring rolls, short ribs, some kind of seafood dumplings and three rolls of sushi. Our table of 11 seemed satisfied with the amount of food we received for the first course. Also, I thought all of it was delicious. \n\nUnfortunately, this is where our fun ended. About an hour later, our waiter comes to our table for the FIRST time since our appetizers were dropped off and asked if we were ready for dessert. We said, \""Ummm, we'd like our dinner first!\"". He acted shocked that we hadn't eaten yet. He left, came back a minute later and said that all of our food was delivered to another table accidentally and that he'd have a new round of food brought to us very quickly, maybe 10 minutes. Well, 20 minutes later, we started to get upset. I told Bobby that we had been waiting too long for our dinner. He tried to claim we had only been waiting 45 minutes, including the mistake. But I disagreed and he got a little upset with me. He told our table 3 minutes and our food would be out. So we waited. Again. Ten more minutes went by and I walked over to an assistant manager and asked him to please get our bill right away because we were leaving. I said we'd be happy to pay for our drinks and all the appetizers. He said that was fine. Moments later the food finally came out. But it was too late.Almost 90 minutes had passed and four people had left our party. \n\nTwo minutes later, Bobby comes back to the table and announces that dessert is on the way - mind you, we didn't get any dinner. I told him to talk with his manager - we had already agreed to pay for what we consumed and we wanted to leave. He got more and more visibly upset with me and our group - he was also having words with the assistant manager after I demanded the bill.\n\nWe finally got the bill and it was $327 and change. For appetizers and about 13 drinks. We tipped %15 percent, even though our service was awful; and he never gave a true apology for screwing up our dinner. \n\nWhat stinks, is that I was the reason my group went to dinner here! I convinced them to go - and we all had an awful experience. Even worse, literally no one from the restaurant seemed to care in the least. Seriously, even the assistant manager admitted it was a long time to wait for dinner, yet after being there for a total of 2 hours, they didn't even comp the drinks. \n\nNeedless to say, I will never go there again. And 10 other people will never go again either. Its a good thing Las Vegas has so many awesome places to dine. And for that reason, you should avoid this establishment!!!"	1
	1281	"I know what The Marvel Experience feels like whenever I've gone and seen a Marvel movie. Fun, excitement, laughter. All joyous emotions. I felt none of that during this experience. This was just flat out horrible on many levels. \n\nI avoided the dreaded $10 parking fee that others encountered. When I went with a buddy of mine Sunday night it was pretty dead. Guess the bad word of mouth had made it thru by then. \n\nThe staff was just so blah. No excitement or enthusiasm of any kind. But I will say that it was at night so maybe they are just tired from repeating the same stuff over and over.\n\nThe \""interactive\"" stuff isn't much. It felt very cheap and that they were thinking. Let's just slap the name Marvel on it and people will love it. The Spider-man wall climb was just a regular rock climbing wall that moved. Would it have killed them to make a rock climbing wall that looked like the side of a high rise building? Or something like a magnet or velcro suit that let's u stick to walls? Dome 1 mostly consisted of monitors that had the origins of the characters which were all covered many times before in Marvel movies and cartoons. And the noise level of the dome drowned out the sound of the televisions, so you couldn't hear anything anyways. The \""museum\"" was a joke. I was thinking it was a hall of Marvel history with props from some of the actual movies. All the props looked like plastic toys you could get a any toy store. Most of the games didn't work right. The holo simulator was ok, but it felt cheap. As far as computer animation has come along the graphics for the heroes in dome 1 was very lackluster. \n\nThe Quinjet that was advertised so much as a life size one that you wouldn't believe it was all one piece. Was just pretty much a wing. There was no cockpit or seats or anything like that. Just more monitors telling you about the origins of the villains.\n\nThey took away our initial bracelets when we reached Dome 2 and I for one have no idea why they gave them to us to begin with. Cause they told us when we first walked in that those bracelets they gave us didn't work. It just made no sense at all. The 3d movie was cool but it ends right when it starts getting good with no conclusion and the staff ushers you right into the next room. The 4d ride was fun for what it was. But again without those bracelets working the part where they want you to interact falls flat. \n\nThe gift shop was full of overpriced items and not many things to choose from.  It consisted of a certain amount of items just spaced out in different parts of the gift shop. \n\nAll in all for $37 its a major ripoff. I would feel like a straight idiot if I paid for the VIP package. The games are the same type of games you would find in a Peter Piper. You would think they would have people dressed up in character costumes walking around the place for photo ops. And it basically focus on The Avengers. If its a true Marvel experience where were all the hundreds of characters that they have in their library?\n \nIf your a 5 year old kid. This place is a blast. I got excited when I first pulled up to the place and I saw those huge domes all glowing and the music blaring. But if your a true Marvel fan thinking your going to go into the mecca of the world of Marvel universe. You'll come out very very VERY disappointed."	0
	1282	"Where do i begin, first off let me say, i originally booked through cassablanca express, and had a room at the rivera but they said this hotel was an upgrade that it had been remodeled etc, so i said hey what the hell.. \n\nI  stood in line for like 40 mins to check in, they only had two women at the front and  a line of 20.\n\nmy room was located in the North Tower, however, for self park it only lets you out on the \""south\"" side. meaning you have to constantly walk a mile to and from car to park \n\nwalking up to room LOUD foul odor, not cool! Room was nice size small TV with 3 working channels, no closet, small bathroom, when i tried to take shower pipes were so loud the entire time, no hot water in shower, in the bathroom the sink had no cold water, shit damn near gave me second degree burns!! loud ass air conditioner.. \nbed was ok. 3 small and i do mean small pillows lol really with a king bed?\n\nso i wanted to go to pool. check in is at 3pm WTF does the pool close at 5pm? really? just really?\n\n\n\n\nCasino was ok. played blackjack most of the time there. and seemed as if dude thought i was counting cards or something the way he never took eyes off my table (crazy shit)\ni think it was rigged lol i was up one sec, and before you know it. dealer just seemed to get the perfect had every time.. cray!\n\n\nOverall i would say that they have some more work to do with the renovation. \n\nthe smell before you even get to the room and the pipes and water thing was overkill for me. hopefully that gets fixed!"	0
	1283	I really enjoy this place. Brought some co workers in for dinner on a Wednesday evening.\nWe were seated asap and sat in front of the large flat screens and counter where you can place bets.\n\nWe watched  baseball and started off with the BBQ shrimp appetizer along with cold beers. For my entree,  I went with the oyster Po Boy which was tasty and came with fries that were just OK. \n\nFor dessert also and I chose the Banana cream pie - Graham cracker crust, caramel sauce, chocolate shavings and fresh whipped cream. The pie was definitely the highlight of the evening with the shrimp appetizer second. \n\nMy co workers enjoyed the evening and the layout of this massive sports bar. The patio is cool BC its facing the strip and even has pool tables you can rent.\n\nPrices here tend to be on the higher side but then again Lagasse's Stadium is one of the best sports bar I've visited.	3
	1284	The store manager got back with me via Yelp, which I greatly appreciate.  In thinking further about my review, I've amended it somewhat to reflect that the store is much more than just framing.  I would still not recommend their framing department, but the rest of the store is well-organized and has a huge selection of art supplies.  Plus, the staff seems very eager to offer expert assistance if you want it.  So a 1 star for framing and a 5 star for supplies leaves me with an aggregate 3 star review.	2
	1285	I really really wanted this place to be awesome.  Not only is it not even close to being only 'okay'... the service is SO bad that I will not go back.  I have yet to receive my order with the right ingredients and they don't even cut them into portions small enough to eat.  Be sure to get a knife to cut things up and watch them like a hawk as they add the fixings you request and pay for!  Oh... and when you try to call and speak with someone... anyone.... to let them know... forget about it.  They won't answer.  Much work to do to get this place right.	0
	1286	"I have been to Artisan After Hours 5 times. My first impression upon entering it on a Saturday morning (Friday After Hours) is that this place is REALLY FUCKING NASTY.  Unfortunately, my opinion has never changed.\n\nThere are bums and hookers everywhere. The ratio runs about 10% female (9 out of 10 of those are trashy escorts), and 90% creepy dudes that didn't get some while they were clubbing from 1030 to 4:00. You can look at their faces to know that they are desperate for some affection. There is a small outside patio next to a flight of stairs where losers sit next to each other telling bullshit war stories about how \""hard\"" they are. \n\nYou also have a really tiny room that is (the dance floor). It's like the size of a dive bar. Too many people inside, and YOU DO NOT WANT TO SIT ON THE TABLES. The hookers that took over the spot will think your a new mark and probably will try to lure you into their hotel room where a big burly guy is gonna rob you at gunpoint. \n\nI guess for a heterosexual chick that doesn't make her living by bed hopping might find this a paradise, a farm full of semi-attractive males that only wants someone to love and care for. But for the masses of single, charming, male bachelors... you would want to try your luck at the Drai's After Hours in the Bills Gambling Hall and Casino on Flamingo & Las Vegas Blvd. It's a much better atmosphere over there, better ratio of male-to-female, and the bouncers actually give a shit about keeping the place upbeat. \n\nI seen a couple of folks at the valet line bitch out their spouses over the phone while I was waiting for my car to come back. A lot of the creepy chomo (child molester looking) type here. \n\nOh, and for first-timers, you NEED to bring your car to the valet. There is no self-parking here. Come in early if you really want to come here, say about 3:30AM when the real clubs are dying down.\n\nUpdate: \n\nSo I got a email saying that alot of people are putting in complaints for this review. I don't know why. I'm not slandering, i'm telling the truth of what I have experienced here. Maybe some folks like the hookers that come in here. \n\nWell I got dragged in here one more time because one of my friends happened to have his peer host a birthday party here. Nothing fancy, just a birthday hangout. On my last visit it looks like Artisan Afterhours cleaned itself up a bit. A little bit less hookers than what I usually encounter (even though I did run into another one at the Wynn outside the Tryst Nightclub at the same day). \n\nSeems like the crowd this time (around late-December) got less shady. The bartenders have very good visual memory of faces. I accidentally left my card at the counter, and when I came back to the bar she remembered my face and handed me back my credit card.. \n\nI didn't have a ride back home so I rented out a room. The guy at the counter cut me some slack and gave me a room for $46 + collateral ($150), usually it goes for $80. Played around with the TV, and I discovered that the TVs in here have free porn channels. Hahaha! \n\nI managed to sleep for 3 hours, but then some random white lady keeps banging at my room's door looking for a \""Allison\"". She won't leave me alone and I kept telling her to go away. Around 10:00AM I got into the elevator to check out and I ran into the lady again. She's a really nosey stranger, and I declined sitting next to her at the taxi stop because asked me a lot of questions about drugs and where to find them."	0
	1287	"Good solid Mexican food, very similar to the style in Texas.  A tad bland for my family but we are more used to California/Baja style.  A nice surprise to find this good of Mexican in NC, good atmosphere and price is right as well.  Had \""Super Nachos\"", also tried \""chile rellanos\"", \""tamales\"" and \""enchiladas\"".  Overall a good dining experience."	2
	1288	Sorry Janice I went to Supercuts instead of to your place and I got a bad haircut. I think you spoiled me Janice. I admit they did not have much to work with but I am uglier than normal now.	0
	1289	Just like many of the other bars that serve food out here. the dining area is separate though and wasnt very crowded so it was pretty quiet. my sister had a wrap with sweet potato fries, i had a penne dish with spinach, chicken, and some other things.  but i really just ate the pasta and picked at everything else. best parts of the meal were the sweet potato fries and the garlic bread that came with my pasta. my pasta was good though, and reheated well as lunch the next day. it was a way bigger serving than i had expected.	2
	1290	I miss LA's Koreatown terribly but this definitely hit the spot. Pretty wide menu with familiar items mixed with more traditional Korean dishes.  Plenty of tables but the place still got packed on a weekday. Korean restaurants tend to be more spendy than other types of Asian food so be ready for that but they have some special deals posted on the wall at certain times. I will definitely be back to Hodori.	3
	1291	This is great when you are in the mood for something different.  As with any family-run hole in the wall, service can be slow, so be prepared.  What the staff lacked in speed, they made up for in charm and smiles.  The food was good, but nothing that wowed me.  I had the pierogis while my friend had swedish meatballs.  Both dishes were tasty, as were the side dishes.  One thing that was disappointing was that the food was a a little cold (lukewarm) when it came out.  Maybe the chef or the staff was having an off day.  The restaurant itself is bright and clean.  I will go back again when I feel like eating outside the box.	2
	1292	There food is delicious and they have a fine selection of gelato. The inclusion of the coffee bar is a nice touch. The spring and fall seem like the best times to go given the beautiful AZ weather. Give this a place a try!	4
	1293	I've driven past this place many times...finally went and was impressed.  It was clean, the people were friendly, and they had a good salsa bar. \n\nHighlights were the habanero salsa, the green salsa, al pastor tacos, and the street corn (elote).  The corn was very flavorful and huge...and they actually brought two ears of corn for one of my friends because they said that they didn't have enough large ears. I will be back for more elote and that salsa.  \nStay away from the fish tacos...not very good (but at least it wasn't fried!).	3
	1294	I was in Phoenix on a business trip and wanted Mexican food. What I enjoyed was beyond belief. Who knew chicken could taste so good. Very interesting favor profile and textures, excellent service, really interesting art (both exterior and interior)  and a chief. Who is both talented and modest. This is NOT your standard street Mexican food. This is solid cooking, fresh ingredients and no pretense. Go there and enjoy.	4
	1295	im so disappointed with my last visit here! i always come here and get their hot chocolate because it was gooooood and taste very hot-chocolatey. but yesterday, my hot chocolate just taste like WATER. so bland, and not hot at all! i have to add lots of sugar and creamer to make it at least have some flavor. Erg! SO DISAPPOINTED!  and they raised the price again. !!!!!!!!!!!!! did you guys noticed that?	0
	1296	I've experienced better service, alcohol and pricing before. I'm glad that Montreal has lots of bars to resort to in case you end up bumping into one of these!\n\nI heard people had greater experiences with 5 a 7 but on a Thursday night.... not the best.\n\nOlder people, not for 20-30 years old	1
	1297	"We stopped by for happy hour. The bloody marys were average at best. The bartender was an exquisite jerk. Rude, negligent, and brusque, he charged us full price for our drinks, and after we pointed out that it was happy hour, he stated \""oh yeah, the only reason you're here.\"" \n\nWe didn't eat anything, so I'd feel bad totally slamming the place, but man, get your service mentality together guys. That was just bad."	1
	1298	I've been back a few times, so thought it was time for an update.  Unfortunately, it was worse than I remembered!  I really don't think the food is very good.  I got the mushroom scramble last time. It was disgusting.  I know those are strong words, but that is the way I feel.  The food is way overpriced for what you get.  I would rather put up with the hoards of annoying people at LGO than eat here.	1
	1299	The burgers, fries and shakes we were anticipating were just mediocre.  Service so sketchy that the manager finally took our order.  Much better available elsewhere with more choices, better service, location and happier employees@	1
	1300	"Yesterday, my daughter and I were given free tickets to see \""The Whispers!\""  As she's never been there before and her birthday is this coming Sunday, I thought why not celebrate?\n\nThe ticket said that we had to arrive before 6:30 to not revert to paying $15 apiece, so we arrived at 6 pm.  Parking is $5, collected as soon as you arrive.  If you want to avoid the mad rush getting outta there, strategically park near the exit (or near where you entered).\n\nThe line wasn't terribly long but the wait for the 8:30 show (2.5 hours)  was unendurable .  If you use either a walker or wheel chair, I don't believe this place is handicap accessible as I saw no ramps for either.  You only have the option to walk upstairs or downstairs.  The facility had minimal air conditioning and with the crowd it was very hot both inside and outside on the patio.  You would think they' would at least have a mist sprinkler system outside along with more chairs!  Also, you could see the patio is desperately in need of structural repairs. Obviously, the facility expected us to buy drinks while we waited.  But who wants to drink over priced alcohol drinks when you're uncomfortably hot and dehydrated? \n\nWhile everyone raves about getting a good view from any seat, the seats themselves are packed closely together.  I'm 5'5\"" and my knees were scrunched by the seat in front of me.  Also if you've heavyset, the seats are small.  Acoustics are good. And I've had yet to attend an event here that starts on time???\n\nOverall, I'd avoid this place.  If you must go, remember:  You get what you pay for."	0
	1301	Went in today for a set of tires.The price was close to other shops i went to. The people i dealt with where fine, they put on the tires, i paid. people today expect shops to bend over backwards for them, not going to happen. as they say it is what it is. if i needed tires i would go back.	3
	1302	"On-time, knew the way to an uncommon, kind of tricky location. No conversation - which is a good thing to me at 8am. Appears it's a $2.75 pick-up charge plus $0.25 for every tenth of a mile. Van was run-down without air conditioning, but it worked.\n\nI handed over $15 for an $11.25 ride, and did not expect change... but  more importantly the driver did not prepare to make change. Not cool when the chick assumes that everyone will tip her 33% for a 5-minute ride. Also not cool that a \""playa\"" takes their reservations..."	2
	1303	Horrible service.  They do more talking then actually working. Brought my car in for alignment and oil change. Was told one hour tops. Three hours later still waiting. Don't go there.	0
	1304	"Stayed here 2 weekends for a business trip. Seems to be a newer hotel in a newer area of Glendale. Rooms were very nice and clean. Continental breakfast was great, and they have fee coffee 24/7. Staff was nice and friendly.\n\nHaving no transportation amenities around the hotel were sparse. The area adjacent is called \""Westgate.\"" It has a few restaurants and a movie theater, which after more than a weekends stay, would probably start to get stale. Location is RIGHT next to Uni of Phoenix stadium and jobing.com arena. I am sure that when there are Sports playing, the area livens up some.\n\nOverall a good experience!"	3
	1305	I'm just so glad website like Yelp exist. It's very edifying to see all the other awful reviews this Verizon location has received...but I can't help but agree with all of them. For one, trying to get this location to pick up the phone is a joke. They don't answer and are probably too self-involved with each other to actually care about the customers they are serving. I mean, that is the one way I can MAYBE compliment the store; all the employees really seem to enjoy working together...but they seem to care less about the people who need their help. Absolutely awful in store customer service and awful wait times. Although it's not as convenient, you are seriously better of doing whatever you business you do with Verizon on a national help line, or online.\n\nCompletely frustrating and sad.	0
	1306	Wear your big pants with the elastic waist when you come here. This place is amazing! The staff is so much fun and nice. The food is so good and they give you so much of it. I'm talking multiple plates with piles of food. The fried chicken was awesome but the smothered chicken was to die for. The greens were well seasoned and the mac n cheese was creamy. What really sets Nana's apart from the other soul food places in the area is that the large plates come with (wait for it) TWO MEATS whereas at most places an upgrade usually gets you another side. Also, the meals include a drink. You definitely get your money's worth here folks.	4
	1307	I've only been here once and both my husband and I were surprised at how good the food happened to be. We didn't actually eat there..We sat at the bar and waited for our food and then took the food home. We were both surprised at how large the menu was and we had a hard time picking out what we wanted to try. We we got home and dug in the food was great and we were NOT disappointed.	3
	1308	I absolutely love this place. Anytime I want inexpensive diner food I go to badger! My favorites: Medium wings, medium-rare burgers, and the chili cheese fries. The wings are super fat and juicy every time I get them. The medium wings are the best and I've had the blackened wings and they were okay, but not really my thing. It is RIDICULOUS that you can get a burger so cheap and that the cooks will make it medium rare. It is so hard to find a good medium rare burger joint! I have to stop myself from getting a tasty burger every time I go there. The chili is to die for and it is even better on fries topped with cheese! I've also had the cheese curds which were good and the pot roast was good. The pot roast had great texture, but needed to be seasoned a bit more. I look forward to trying more meals here!	4
	1309	"The atmosphere is kind of cool.  It's a good place to watch the game.  There are tons of TVs, so you know you will have a good view no matter where you sit.  \n\nAs far as the food goes, I don't think I would eat here again. I had a combo basket with boneless wings and pretzels.  The wings were very dry...they were coated in sauce, but the chicken itself was dry. The pretzels were bland.  I tried my husband's cheese fries and they were nothing special either.  Our friend said his burger was \""okay, but nothing special.\"""	1
	1310	worst show ever. \n\nMy friends and I got free tickets, and we left in the middle of the show because it was so lame. In the beginning a guy tossed bottles for 10 minutes, and came back again later to toss hats for another 10 minutes.... you got to be kidding me.	0
	1311	Kind of creepy walking around the halls at night because it's dark and you just get this eerie feeling. Plus the halls kind of wrap around the center of the pyramid and there's nothing really pleasant to look at at the bottom of it all. I don't know how to explain it better and I wish I still had the picture I took... \nAnyway, I didn't stay here but I visited my friend's room and it's definitely NOT one of the nicer places to stay on the strip. I'm sure the price reflects it though, right?? Oh well, not like you spend much time in there so I guess it doesn't matter TOO much. But eh you're in Vegas might as well splurge for a nicer place	1
	1312	Best Colombian food in Charlotte. Hands down. The Churrasco is excellent.	4
	1313	I was in Charlotte this past weekend, my friend took me here for dessert and I fell in love with this Parisian designed bakery. The decor of this place in a little bit romantic, a little bit eclectic and definitely fun (love the chandelier made out of mini pots/pans). I can't give it more stars because the desserts were hit & miss. I had 3 desserts, yes that's correct 3. The first was the best, a chocolate cup filled with passion fruit chocolate ganache: this was really good, smooth, loved the passion fruit flavor! The second was decent, a coconut macaroon: the outside was nice and crisp but the inside was not as soft as I'm accustomed to. The third dessert was a bit of a disappointment, it was an orange chiffon cake: the cake was quite dry, the frosting was too think for my taste. So I guess 2 out of 3 was not bad, so if next time I'm in Charlotte I'll have to try a few more.	2
	1314	"I like Vinnie's as well. The oysters are great, and in my opinion are the main reason to go there. The po-boy's are also pretty good, and the one time I had the fish sandwich I remember it being tasty. (Not sure if it was labeled as grouper or not.)\n\nThey usually have decent beer specials, with one dollar domestics making an appearance from time to time. \n\nThey do tend to hire only \""hotties\"" for the most part. I've never had that negatively impact my own personal service experience, but take it for what you will.\n\nMy only real complaint is that they turn the music way up at night. I could understand if the place is rocking, but I've been there on nights when there where only a handful of tables seated and the music was still at dance club decible levels. I can't be the only one that likes to talk to the people I am eating with.\n\nOverall, it's a good place to go have beers and oysters with the guys."	2
	1315	"Tusitala, meaning \""storyteller,\"" after Robert Louis Stevenson's Samoan nickname is a restaurant and event venue in the south of Edinburgh.\n\nIt has a varied menu which includes everything from stone baked pizza to seafood to liver dishes.  Tusilata clearly knows its market - it's clientele appears to be groups of families and friends spanning the generations and it's menu is reflective of this.\n\nThere is a car park and ramp wheelchair access and spacious disabled WC/baby changing facilities.\n\nWe were in a group of seven this time and we all ordered different dishes. The highlights round the table were a Moroccan style Chorizo and chickpea stew, a salad Nicoise and the saut\u00e9ed liver and chips. I chose a Treasure Island stone baked pizza and have to say I was a wee bit disappointed with its presentation, which largely appeared to consist of the base and it's tomato topping and not enough goats cheese, basil etc promised on the menu. \n\nIn saying that, I think I was just unlucky as the other pizza ordered at the table looked awesome.\n\nFantastic for a nice family meal: staff are very patient and friendly with food decent enough for the price charged but I probably wouldn't go out my way otherwise for say a special dinner for two."	2
	1316	The valet here is extremely rude . This is the second bad experience I have had with valet . On top of it I tipped him 5$ and no thank you just a blank stare . I am in the hospitality industry and you must always say thank you .	0
	1317	another great Worldmark location in Vegas and only 2 miles or so off the strip.  we were bummed the pool was closed for maintenance, but happily hopped into the jacuzzi for much needed muscle relief from our adventures on the Strip.\n\nwe stayed in their huge 1 bedroom unit with all the amenities you need for 1 to 7+ nights in Vegas.  it comfortably fits 4 adults with a firm king bed in the bedroom and another firm Murphy bed in the living room.  the full kitchen has all you need for preparing meals, complete with dishes, utensils, and cookware.\n\nit's definitely my favorite property so far and way too conveniently located down the street from The Orleans, lots of restaurants, and of course just next door to the Strip.  you can't beat their shuttle service drop at Caesar's Forum Shops running every hour until midnight.	4
	1318	I hadn't eaten here for quite a while, but I'm glad I did! The environment is louder but that's because it's mixed with restaurant and bar. The service is great and friendly. The portion sizes were large & plenty. Choices, choices, choices too....salad, pasta, pizza....so many choices in each type of food. To top it off...awesome pizza!!! Why did I stay away so long???? Be back very soon!	4
	1319	After we found out we were pregnant, I started doing some research on these elective ultrasound places. I was convinced they'd be super expensive, but was really surprised when I found Prenatal Peek's website. When I showed their packages and photos to my husband, we decided we'd have to come here later during the pregnancy with our family (who would visit from out of town) for a 3D session. \n\nJump forward about three months, and we were just SO READY to know what we were having already! Our OB's office generally scheduled the mid-pregnancy (or anatomy, or 20 week, or whatever you want to call it) ultrasound at 20 weeks. This is when, had we chosen to wait, we'd find out the gender. I hopped back on to Prenatal's website, and discovered that they had a 2D gender determination package available for a totally reasonable price that they started at 15 weeks! At our next OB appointment, we spoke with our doctor about wanting to find out early and she gave us her blessing to visit an elective place. She told us to wait until 16 weeks, just to be sure, and to go for it! I called Prenatal Peek immediately upon leaving that appointment. They were extremely friendly and accommodating and were able to get us in that week! We were so excited. \n\nThe day before the appointment I received a confirmation reminder and they offered directions to the little historic bungalow that they were located in. Very sweet. I don't think I slept that night! The day of we arrived early and were immediately warmly greeted. We filled out some simple paperwork in their living room style waiting area and then were told to come on back! We met our tech ( I wish I remembered her name) who was just so sweet. The viewing room itself was HUGE and had a big, comfy hospital style bed for me with a large couch, recliners, and plenty of other seating for my husband. There was even a kid's corner with toys (they welcome other siblings!). She got started right away and explained everything she was doing and looking for. It calmed us both down immediately. Within minutes she asked us, 'ok, are you ready?!' and told us that we were having a little GIRL! It was amazing. Since our daughter was being so cooperative and she found all of her parts right away, she went back over her body, her face, and her heartbeat for us to see. It was wonderful! The ultrasound itself lasted about fifteen minutes, and when it was over she gave us a roll of photos to take home. \n\nWe couldn't have been more pleased with our experience here. Everyone we talked to, from calling to make the appointment to signing in to the tech herself, was so incredibly sweet and thorough. We absolutely CAN'T WAIT to come back later this summer to treat our family to a 3D/4D ultrasound!! If you're looking for an affordable, professional and super friendly elective ultrasound place in Phoenix I highly recommend Prenatal Peek.	4
	1320	This is a review for the restaurant inside of the casino. \n\nI've always been a fan of hooters wings and curly fries. So, after seeing a show we stopped here to eat. My husband and I both got wings. They were cold. Cold enough that they could have been cooked and put in the fridge. \n\nThis is the only hooters that hasn't been spot on with the wings. \n\nService wasn't great either. We got our food and no one came to check on us for 20 minutes and I clearly wasn't eating my food. \n\nAt least the curly fries were good, and warm. \n\nOverall cold food and bad service, and they weren't even busy!	1
	1321	"\""Before both of my feet fully entered Flicka's, I knew I had already contracted the Swine Flu..\"" Thanks to Georgie S, I now know why I have a sore throat, cough and achy body. Thanks Flicka's for giving me Swine Flu. \n\nThis place is really disorganized, the wait staff (the bartenders the waitresses the bussers) are all really snotty and were all rude, not to mention slow as the second coming. \n\nThe nicest person in that bar was the little Mexican flower guy who fell in love with me and gave me a pair of roses, free of charge. \n\nThe one good thing about this bar was the cheap beers. My Corona was $2.50 and the Bud Lights were $2. \n\nThe outdoor patio is cool, but it is filled with all the smokers so unless you want to catch lung cancer, it is smart to just stay inside. \n\nMy friends band played (I have seen them play at least a dozen times in a variety of venues) and the sound was so horrible. You couldn't hear vocals at all. \n\nIn between the 5 rock bands that played, they piped R&B music over the speakers. I thought this was a little strange.... and I also found the massive dance orgy that busted out to be a little strange.\n\nSome dude sent his wing-woman over to the bar while I was getting drinks to try and get me to join their table. She was the oldest looking wing-woman I have ever seen. It made me immediately want to cancel my tanning membership. \n\nWhat a really weird group of people here. Seriously. \n\nI didn't really care for the food. I consider myself a nachos connoisseur now that I date Dallas G, and these nachos were sub-par. \n\nI highly doubt I will ever be back to this weird ass place!"	1
	1322	"I really didn't think I'd find a place that makes Hooters' food seem good. Here it is, the Tilted Kilt.\n\nI ordered the Cajun Chicken Salad. The chicken had some seasoning on it, but not enough flavor to discern whether or not it was Cajun spices or colored talcum powder. Then, here is where you're going to tell me I went wrong, I really don't like ranch style dressing so I asked to have honey mustard instead. I love mustard and figured the honey and mustard would complement the Cajun spices well. I'm not sure what kind of dressing they put on, but I would have trouble convincing anyone that it was honey mustard. It tasted like the mayonnaise dressing my mother used to put on her Waldorf salad, but worse. It was runny, flavorless, and really only seemed to function to hold the salad in a dome shape. Lastly, it was obvious the tomato used in the salad never reached maturity. It was one of those green tomatoes that are thrown into a room with ethylene gas to turn them red, but really they're just red-colored green tomatoes--crunchy, and absolutely devoid of flavor. Were they trying to use it in place of croutons?\n\nOK, I know you're also going to say, \""You don't go to the Tilted Kilt for the food.\"" Yeah, I've heard that one before. Then maybe they should stop serving food. They could just serve nachos and wings, like the bowling alley.\n\nI just have two pieces of advice for this place: Step up your game with your food. Make it taste like what you're billing it as. Cajun chicken should be, well, Cajun! Honey mustard dressing should taste like it has ... wait for it, honey and mustard in it. And, if you can't fix it, take it off the menu. I'd be embarrassed to serve something so awful.\n\nOK, enough of that. Our server was pleasant and nice, but she never once asked me about my meal. Showed no concern whether my meal was good or not. I was a little disappointed by that, but it's probably best. I wasn't in any mood to be dishonest with her.\n\nI ended up paying my bill and jetting. I had some leftover chili from home sitting in the hotel fridge screaming at me to be eaten.\n\nSo, yes I know, you don't go to the Tilted Kilt for the food. Then why bother serving food? I'm so over the tired, hackneyed shtick at these places I just want a decent, well-made meal. Maybe someone could put that shtick in a restaurant and actually make food worth eating? What an odd thought?\n\nAnd finally, just so I can continue this mindless rant. I've had good bar food all over this country. This ain't it."	0
	1323	I've been to Fresh Mint several times over the past years and always have a great meal. Having changed jobs, I find myself in that part of town less, but revisited last week with a vegetarian friend and a girlfriend who dabbles. I, on the other hand, enjoy being an omnivore, but regardless of culinary position, this place is just plain great. I'm amazed at how flavorful the sauces are and the menu is fairly diverse with great choices. It's run by a husband/wife team who do the serving and cooking, so you're basically eating their home-cooked meals. I've heard it is also a Kosher certified restaurant, so you know you're getting quality food.	3
	1324	Found hair in soup and waiter lied said its something else. Service is bad and unresponsive. Food was not good. Believe me I'm a cook. Im also a well travelled asian. 2 star for decent atmosphere. Good job interior designer.	1
	1325	Really confusing airport.  We were just picking up a buddy adn... well... it was really confusing.\n\nLAX seems more organized than this place.\n\nThat's not good.	1
	1326	They have changed owners and we do not go there. They do not go out of their way to help you in a crunch. No need for them with so many other places to choose from.	1
	1327	So delicious! Joe is AMAZING! Got the waffle and it jut melts in your mouth :) Mmmmm!!	4
	1328	"So I just had to try out this hype that everyone is raving about. So I took my kiddo friend with me to check it out. We both ordered our own ninja sized (I assume that with a ninja size some ninja with a samurai is slicing up ice cubes to ice snow perfection). My friend ordered a mango flavor one with gummy bears, mango pieces, and m&ms, with chocolate drizzle. I made my own and ordered a green tea flavored one with mochi pieces, captain crunch , and almond bits, with condense milk. \n\nSo the place is very clean, fun, and contemporary. Big ups for them for having a charging station/bar. That was pretty cool. The deco is very contemporary, with that \""yogurtland\"" feel to it. That's probably not a good way to describe them since they're far from a yogurt place. So as I eat my snow ice concoction I'm brushing up on my shave ice 101 by reading up on Tony T's review. As I'm taking bites of my shave ice I'm thinking...\""Yes! Tony! Yes! This is true!\"" or \""No! Tony! No! It can't be\""....after my 5 minute lesson I did learn...\n\nThe shave ice should have minimal ice crystals if not null. The ice shavings should melt in your mouth. Unfortunately, caught red handed, I did have a bunch of ice crystals in my shave ice. I wanted it to taste more creamy and melt in your mouth like than it was. It was delicious, but as far as trying to be different and veering away from some yogurt stereotype...I doubt it. I couldn't find an indifference from other frozen treat places. What they offered made me question every second if I would rather go to a yogurt place. The toppings are the same. Flavors are the same if not limited in variety. Quality of the shave ice is subpar. Don't know if I'd choose this place over a yogurt shop yet...I think they're dying for something to make them stand out."	2
	1329	"Let me start by saying my review has nothing to do with the food, which was terrific.  It has to do with the service which was terrible all the way around. Hostes starts off by being rude to my kids who went in first to get a table. Walked up, took menus and walked away without saying anything to them.  It took about 15 steps for her to turn around and look at them as if they were stupid for not following her.  After that she gave them a hard time when they told her we had a party of 5, initially refusing to put together two tables to fit us.\n\nNext, our waitress was late (apparently 30 min), which I didn't need to know, but the waitress staying to cover felt obligated to share. New waitress came, introduced herself by saying...you waiting on anyone else? In addition to staring at herself in the wall mirror the whole time we were ordering, she didn' pay attention to what we were asking her.  Then,  when my mom paid and said, \""keep the change (16% tip even with cruddy service) she brought back the changed and slapped it down, saying here's the change and gave a bad look.  \n\nI would have complained to the manager, but after watching her treatment of the woman behind us who had to wait 40 minutes to get her food done correctly, I choose not to.  That woman was smart, since the manager wouldn't give her a break on the bill she simply put the tab on the table, said, I guess this one's on you, and left."	1
	1330	"Good energy, fine menu, earnest servers.\nHowever...\nAs evidenced by the steam that poured out when I cut it open, my salmon spent too much time under the heat lamp (I had asked for it to be medium-rare, while another in our arty wanted his well-done), so I told our server immediately, who graciously offered another. This one came out, literally and totally raw in the center. Though I like my food on the under-done side, this was disgusting. It felt like a \""gotcha\"" from the kitchen; wholly uncalled-for, and it felt very insulting. Not to mention inedible. I flagged down our server, who of course apologized profusely (it was not her fault). She took it away. Time passed (a lot). I ordered dessert. Our server said she would \""comp\"" it to make up for the salmon fiasco. 15 minutes later we told her we just needed our bill as it was now 6:40 and we needed to get to the Herberger.\nSo all in all, it was a pretty disappointing experience.\n\nAnd their website doesn't provide any way to email them directly:  uncool."	1
	1331	Remember, Opinions.\n\nIt's been about 2 weeks since i've eaten here and I can still remember how mediocre the food quality was. I remember ordering a pizza, some pasta, and some fried calamari. In short, the Calamari was good, but it wasn't THAT good. I've had better eating at a karaoke joint. The Pizza was a small portion, it looked good but it tasted average. You can taste the freshness, but for some reason i couldn't be enjoying it for the money and size that it was. The pasta felt as if it was drenched with sauce. It tasted good but only if I were someone who didn't mind if it were smothered too much with sauce.\n\nCustomer service was good though. Our waitress was friendly and had a good attitude so I believe this review deserved an extra star. I think I remember paying $60 to $70 for pasta, pizza and fried Calamari, and one hot tea.\n\nNot really the place i would recommend for italian, unless you're very hungry. They also have a to-go window right next to the entrance.	1

	1333	This place is a life saver.  Unfortunately over the years I have had to bring in our pets with various degrees of illnesses.  They have always provided outstanding service and are there when your regular Vet is not open.  They have always given our pets great service and explain everything to us in a caring and loving manner.  If you are in need of a Vet outside of your normal Vet's hours, I would definitely recommend them. They are experienced in all kinds of injuries and illnesses and can be the difference between life and death for your best friends.\nThanks again.	4

	1335	"I enjoyed our experience at Hofbrauhaus.  We went on a Sunday afternoon around 3:30 so the cavernous restaurant seemed very empty.  We were quickly greeted and our request for a table inside but with a view of the river was accommodated with a smile.  \n\nWe started with the \""Works\"" sampler.  Because it was slow in the restaurant, the food came out much more quickly than we had expected it to.  It was tasty and quite a bit of food.  However, it cost more than either of our entrees did.  The pretzels were the standard soft pretzel.  The bier cheese, however, was fantastic!  I wish they would have given us more than just the small cup worth.  The plate also included fried pickels (which were pretty standard as well).  What stood out wer ethe sauerkraut balls (served with honey mustard).  They were unique, crisp and tasty.  The combo was rounded out with potato pancakes served with applesauce.  While I enjoyed the potato pancakes, I expected better from a German restaurant.\n\nMain entrees were the Jagerscnitzel and Kasespatzle.  The Jagerschnitzel is pork with a wine mushroom/bacon sauce.  The pork was tender and the breading crisp and tasty.  It came with a delectable German potato salad and a fried cabbage that I can't say much more about other than \""meh.\""\n\nThe Kasespatzle was, as expected, very heavy (the dish contains swiss cheese, onions nad heavy cream sauce).  It was too much for my taste, but my fiance loved it.  \n\nWhile we were dining, a leiderhosen clad accordian player kept the small crowd entertained with traditional German favorites with the Chicken Dance thrown in for good measure.  \n\nOverall, we had an enjoyable and tasty experience.  Hofbrauhaus certainly won't be a regular stop, but we will visit again."	3

	1338	We went for dinner on a Saturday night.  We sat inside and we loved the environment.  The chips were thin and delicious and the green and (fire roasted) red salsas were both very good.  We had the Carne Asada and the chicken and steak Fajitas.  They were both fabulous along with the beans and rice.  We also had an on-tap IPA and the Flirtini, both of which were quite good.  The price was reasonable and the service was great.  I'd highly recommend this restaurant!	4
	1339	"I wasn't impressed.\n\nDuring the start of a girls weekend in Vegas, we set our sights on Secret Pizza early on.  Once we \""found it\"" (super easy to find), we walked down the album covered hallway to discover minimal seating and zero ambiance.  The pizza is about as good as an average NY pizzeria (which is to say, it's better than most places =P), so if you're looking for a slice of home, that is what you'll get.  Nothing too special, definitely solid, but this stop was definitely made for post Marquee fuel.  If you want better pizza spot with more ambiance, head over to the Aria and hit up Five50."	2
	1340	My favorite place for all you can eat sushi! Lunch is $22, dinner is $25. They also offer a la carte rolls if that's your forte, but why not splurge?! All You Can Eat also includes things like (but not limited to) soup, edamame, tempura, yakitori, and ice cream. I love the open feel of the new location (original is at Flamingo & Rainbow).	4
	1341	"Growing up I could walk to a Sonic from my house.  So I am too familiar with all the goodness that America's drive-in has to offer.  When we moved to Vegas we noticed that Sonic's are here in Vegas but not a lot.  We live over by the South point so we actually have to travel to the 2 Sonic's that are sort of close by.  If you haven't had a sonic burger, toaster, or coney then you are probably from the east coast.  Sonic is the place in the southwest.  I will always get a Super Sonic Cheeseburger.  How can you go wrong when the word \""Super\"" is in the name of your burger.  I am from New Mexico and you will notice that there is a topping called green chiles.  Don't confuse this with jalapenos.  This is the real deal and I think it is actually hatch green chile.  My wife always gets the coney dog.  Sonic was also one of the first fast food place to serve breakfast all day.  I don't really like eating in the car but we have 2 small children and it's kind of easy when they are strapped in their seats.  So if you haven't had a Sonic burger you are missing out.  Make sure to get cheese and green chiles on your burger! Cheers!"	3
	1342	Pretty good food . The orange juice is made at the bar. The servers were attentive. The pancakes were amazing and huge.	3
	1343	We came here after a fun night downtown with friends. We wandered in and decided we wanted to get our hands on the the infamous $5.99 Prime Rib dinner.\n\nThe cafe is pretty clean and modern. Much nicer than I would expect from this place. We sat down and were immediately greeted by our server for our drink order. Service was fast and friendly and I was very impressed by the place at first glance. We were about to order the Prime Rib dinner but then the Steak and eggs caught all of our eyes and we decided to go with that instead. It was about 10:40pm, this matters because the Steak and Eggs aren't available until 11. Our server told us he'd take care of us and not make us wait until 11, awesome.\n\nThe food was pretty good and it was cooked exactly to order. Our server was attentive with refills and getting us everything we needed to enjoy our meals. \n\nA meal for four for under $25, can't beat that. Definitely a better than expected experience here! I'll be back for sure!	3
	1344	I feel I can't be 100% fair since I did not order the pizza or a regular entree but what I did order was a disappointment so that is what I am judging here.  \n\nThe minestrone cup of soup was not bad but nothing special and my side salad was inedible due to the ocean of balsamic vinegar that was poured onto it.  The croutons were so soaked they were black.  I had to ask the waitress to please take it off our bill.\n\nMy parents were satisfied with their eggplant parm plate and chicken parm hero but I wouldn't think a bowl of soup and a salad would be that difficult to get right.\n\nFrom what I saw the pizza looked like pizza hut or dominoes style not real pizza...\n\nI don't think I would go back here.	1
	1345	OMG me and my daughter just ate here I paid 13.28 for both of us adults 6.99 kids 4 bucks and the food was delicious specifically the baked mussels and the sushi I'm coming here again I'm in shocked on how cheap it was and so good...	3
	1346	I went for UK Thursdays and had a blast.  If there hadn't been a shooting and stabbing at PHX (stay classy people) we could have partied here all night.	3
	1347	"Do NOT expect timely service....or really any service at all.  Thankfully, due to them not getting me a quote because \""they are busy\"", I found Andrews Party Rentals and went with them for an event.  Also, as noted in other reviews, keep in mind that they will not actually bring the items to the location, but actually only dump them off curbside.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm not keen on dragging tables, linens, heaters, ,etc off of the curb and into the actual location of the event.  I gave them 1 star only because you have to in order to post a review."	0
	1348	Really nice and fun!  Get there a bit early to get a decent seat.  The chairs are a little close together though and the rounding servers for drinks sometimes disappear.  The place is really clean from the beach to the bathrooms.	2
	1349	I came back here to try something else besides my favorite egg foo young.  I had the shrimp fried rice.  I must say that I was very impressed.  Some places leave a layer of oil at the bottom of the rice container.  This not the case here.  I requested that they added garlic to my fried rice and it was a very good touch.	3
	1350	I thought this place was just ok. It could have been what I ordered. I would give it another go.	2
	1351	I was somewhat excited to try this place. Then I saw the menu as I was walking in. It looked revolting. I don't want to know that the fries are done in 100% lard and that the milkshakes are made with pure butter fat. The beer selection was less than mediocre. The ambiance wasn't great. \n\nThen I told them I didn't want to wear the nasty smock-thing they want to put on you, and they told me I had to. So I walked out. I'm guessing I saved myself several days worth of calories for not much taste. I ended up at Chicago Brewing Company at 4 Queens, which, while it's not as good as the original in Summerlin, still kicks the shit out of the Heart Attack place.\n\nAnd really? You eat for free if you're over 350 pounds? That should be illegal.	0
	1352	This place was extremely rude when asked to fill a catering order for my coworkers and I at work. They would not work with us and treated us like we were not wanted. Avoid this place like the plague	0
	1353	The coffee is smooth and delicious, not to mention delicately brewed and roasted on site. The staff is always friendly eager to help you to make an informed decision about your drink, and I have yet to get a smug look from any of them when I feign ignorance about any drinks. That little test tells me an awful lot about an establishment, and it goes without saying that, while Cartel is a coffee connoisseur's delight, it works just as well for those who might not have a handle on the finer details of this art. \n\nIf there's anything to complain about this fine establishment, it's that there's always a crowd, lending it to being a less than ideal setting to sit and relax, due to a dearth in seating. But if you can find a spot to plop down, you're in perhaps the finest coffee establishment in all of Arizona. That's not an exaggeration.	4
	1354	If there were a way to take away stars, I would use it on this establishment.  I contacted Big Two Mitsubishi to inquire about a used car they had advertised.  The initial inquiry went well.  A salesperson named Nissa answered my questions via email.  Because I was looking at several cars around the valley, I didn't get back to her right away, so she started getting pushy about me coming in to test drive the car.  I agreed to come in after work, but when I got to the dealership for the test drive, she handed me over to another salesperson, who was new but very nice.  I liked the car and was ready to deal, so we walked back in to the dealership and Nissa took over again.  She was sitting at a desk in the middle of their building.  Started the sales process right there, in front of other salespeople and customers.  I was standing, and since it was at the end of a long work day, I would really have appreciated being offered a seat, preferably in an office area so we could talk and negotiate more comfortably and not in a public setting.  \n\nIt ended up that the chair wasn't needed.  Nissa quickly became combative and unwilling to negotiate at all, especially given the condition of the vehicle.  She claimed that Big Two had put lots of money into reconditioning the car, so I asked for the service records to see what they had done.  You would have thought I'd asked for the holy grail.  She was visibly angry and I was ready to walk out when the assistant GM came over.  He had heard some of the conversation was was more than willing to pull the service records for me.  \n\nI offered a fair starting price for negotiations with Nissa.  She refused to budge from her extremely inflated number.  You would think that in a case like this, knowing I needed a car, she would at least offer other options if we were not going to be able to come to an agreement on that car.  NOPE.  Nothing.  I have never had such a bad experience with customer service, even in the automobile sales industry.  \n\nWhile I appreciated Bob's efforts, they were not enough to make up for the aggressive, rude behavior of his sales person.  I will NEVER go back to Big Two Mitsubishi.  Given that I bought a Toyota and live in Chandler, now I'm going to have to think very hard about whether I will take my car to Big Two Toyota.  If Big Two runs all their businesses like this, I think I'm better off taking my chances elsewhere.	0
	1355	"Cool entrance down a staircase into the club and always top notch artists and DJs performing, but that's it.  \n\nIt gets so crowded that dancing at this \""dance\"" club is literally not an option.  Crowded and hot.  Plus it is shaped like an airport terminal, so if you make your way through the masses of sweaty grenades, the only way back to the other side is to turn around, put your riot gear on, and walk right back the way you came.  Stupidest club design ever in history.  Crowd is B-list at best."	1
	1356	just left saigon kitchen  had a bad experience which will not bring me back  discovered a white single hair in my shrimp  told server which she gave a generic apology and i ask for the check and left  i wouldve at least expected a manager to speak to me and apologize but didn't happen.  Server gave me the check I paid the bill and left.	0
	1357	I love going to casinos and enjoying myself... except this one... which simply wants to make me leave and save up for a Las Vegas vacation. Some of the worst slot machines, ever. Some of them are just so old that they date from the date that the casino was opened. The newer ones don't seem to include very many popular machines (which makes me think that someone is buying machines based on price... or based on kickback.) The few popular machines, like Monopoly have people crowding around waiting for people to leave. High limits on tables, if you can find one or a space at one. Minimum $25 at the card tables, $10/$15 on craps. Casino employees are government employees and yet now they have signs and expect tips. Still low on customer service.\n\nFrankly, it's time to shut this down and hire a for-profit company to do this right. Beautiful building... lousy casino.	0
	1358	"Wow! Right next to my hotel in Scottsdale. This place only has maybe 10 tables inside with some outside seating. The waiter recommended the Pasta Giuseppe. He was right! Penne pasta with I think is a vodka sauce with meat and sausage. I've never tasted sauce like this! It was awesome! A little spicy so I didn't need to add crushed pepper. I just added a little parmesan out of habit but it didn't need it. The sauce was not red. It was orange with small size pieces of meat. I wish I could eat it all! Yum! :-) \n       As MacArthur said, \""I'll be back\"""	4
	1359	If you like great service and an even better all natural yogert this is the place be!  Be Warned... Red Mangot's relaxing environment can become highly addictive and you might find yourself there daily.	4
	1360	This place has some amazing food. The price is pretty high for what you are actually getting. Seems like mainly hipsters go here to hang out so I always take my food to go. The music played in the background by the band is annoying and overpowering. I couldn't even have a conservation with girlfriend when we went out here. To go is the way to go.	1
	1361	Menu has everything you would find at a family restaurant and the prices are low to medium. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. Breakfast is the best  priced and comes out fast. Mostly caters to the local older crowd. A great place for a quick meal. No frills but has nice outdoor seating as well. THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH OR CHECK to keep prices down but have an ATM nearby if you need it. I've never had a bad meal here.	4
	1362	"This review greatly saddens me. To quote the most interesting man in the world \""I don't always write reviews, but when I do....it's important.\"" \n\n        I'm writing about my AWFUL experience in dealing with Mark's cleaners. I will attempt so do so succinctly as possible. I dropped off an order SPECIFICALLY to be picked up next day because I was leaving out of town. I made it abundantly clear that I needed it next day for a very important trip. This entire conversation occurred with Brian (the manager). I made it clear that I would be a new customer if everything went well and the service was quality. He said no problem come back tomorrow anytime after 5.\n\n      The next day I show up and the fun begins. My order of course was not completed. The ladies there were in a daze and could not locate my clothes. Everything was so unorganized; it was a mess. Finally, we narrowed down the few spots the shirts could be. I then had to locate them myself because they had no system of keeping track of them. The only problem with that was the shirts wear soaking in this solution that was in the back of the facility. The conditions were deplorable. It was really just an awful experience to have to personally find my clothes in this heaping pile of filth. After 30 mins I located all 9 of my shirts. They were completely soaked! Long story short I took them home with the help of the ladies that were working there. I gave them my card and told them that I expect a call from Brian. \n\n       Long story short I spend 3-4 hours cleaning my shirts at home, learning how to launder my really pricy custom shirts at home with a conventional washer dry. It was certainly an adventure i will never forget. \n\n     Upon returning from my trip I realized I had never received a call. I call Brian (The excuse of a Manager) to see how he could try to resolve my awful experience.  This guy had noting. All he said was \"" I'm sorry\"" and \"" I don't know what else to tell you.\"" Completely apathetic to the awful predicament  this established put me in. I had left one tie there because we couldn't find it originally. He didn't even offer to give me a discount for the dry cleaned tie. He charged me $3:50 for the tie. \n\n        In conclusion, it's not that fact they made a mistake, or the fact that conditions were awful, or even that Brian was a royal douche. What really made this one of the worst business transactions for me was the mishandling at every step, and the unwillingness to make things right.  I hate writing reviews but this one had to be done in such detail because of the egregious errors in customer service.  Anybody knows that's eventually mistakes will happen at the dry cleaners, but their willingness to fix the situation is what separates the good from the bad."	0
	1363	If you're going to Vegas to have a good time, make sure you stop by Indoor Skydiving. I could complain that it was expensive. I certainly wouldn't have minded had it been cheaper. I did get a military discount though, which was great. ($15 off). I went to Vegas to have some great experiences, so I didn't care much about the price.\n\nThe staff was excellent. I guess I'd be in a good mood, too, if I could fly around all day. I was in a pretty good mood just having done it for a few minutes.\n\nThe experience depends. You might go and get a couple minutes. When I went, it was just me and this awesome Australian guy. We had to wait for the previous group to go in and get out, but I ended up with way more time than I expected. Our instructor showed us some things, then brought us each out. He'd toss us back to the side and tell us to jump back into the middle. More often than not, you won't be angled right and go flying off course. Even still, that's awesome!\n\nThe instructor will usually keep his hands on you. You'll spend most of your time about 3 feet off the ground. If he trusts you, he'll let you soar. And it's glorious. Certainly, the experience is over too quickly, but that's because I'd still be in there if I could. The Australian dude went back for seconds, which he got to do all by himself.\n\nEven though you're basically just floating in air, your muscles get a workout. You've got to hold your arms and legs at weird angles for a long time. I'm very in shape, but my butt hurt for a while afterward. You have to bend your body into a U shape, against the hurricane-force wind. If you don't do that everyday, you'll get tired. If you do, what on earth are your hobbies?\n\nAt the very end of your session, your instructor will get to show off. He'll do crazy acrobatics that will provoke insane jealousy. All you can do, though, is go again or ask for an application.\n\nFor the naysayers, Yes, the flying time is relatively short. I've been skydiving and it's awesome. You can squeeze a few extra minutes from the experience, plus there's more scenery on the way down. Skydiving, though, is no joke. If you're scared of heights, it might not be for you. You also need more training to go alone, otherwise you'll spend the jump strapped to someone else. It's also more expensive. \n\nIf you want to have a great time during some afternoon in Vegas, definitely check it out.	4
	1364	"A must go to place for breakfast, brunch or lunch in Vieux Quebec.  My wife found it extremely \""cute\"" and fell in love with the place.  If you go around 11 you will be in good shape for an early lunch or brunch.  Breakfast did not seem to be much of a jam on the weekday we went (we went twice by the way). \n\nAll the pastries are wonderful, especially the cheese biscuit which has a little cayenne kick to it.  \n\nWifey loved the cuban panini.  I thought the filling was great but I personally am not a big fan of overly toasted bread (not burnt).  That being said, I would order one of their paninis again any day and love to devour some cheese biscuits for dessert.  And do yourself a favor and get a large cappucino.\n\nNot really that expensive in comparison to all the tourist traps you could get sucked into in the Old City."	3
	1365	I was only here briefly, but after seeing how one of the employees was totally dressed down by her boss, in front of a customer, I don't think I'll be shopping here.	0
	1366	I was pleasantly surprised by this market. I was expecting something along the lines of a Food City. \nI walked in and was blown away! The prepared foods area is amazing. They have many varieties of freshly made Aguas Frescas, shrimp and fish ceviche, salsa, fresh tortillas, and so much more! \nI took home some of the shrimp cocktail they were sampling for $1.00 per container!\nThe bakery is awe inspiring. They have tons of baked goods at exceptional prices. \nThe produce was beautiful and inexpensive. The meat and seafood sections were very clean and had a great variety. \nThis is my Mexican version of Lee Lee. (Ranch Market smells much better). \nGo here...Eat Shop Enjoy!	3
	1367	I love it too much here! Only downside is that it's so good there's always a lot of people but the wait is definitely worth it. Must try!!	4
	1368	Ok, first off, it has to be known that I am not anywhere near of being a vegan.  I love my filet mignon, chicken piccante, and sea bass.  But I am always up for trying new things and my friend wanted to meet their last night for dinner, so I was game.\n\nI was pleasantly surpised with my choices...though i wished I ordered what my friend ordered.  (I ordered a lemongrass seaweed tofu thing, that I cannot remember the name of it for the life of me)  She even said she liked my entree much better than her Vegetarian Spare Ribs (which I though was AMAZING) I also ordered cucumber rolls, since I saw that it had white radishes in them (YUM)  \n\nSo, now I know one thing...I have a distaste for Tofu.  But I will not hold it against the establishment since it isn't their fault.  But it was their fault that I was sweating like a pig in that place.  \n\nThe staff was very nice and helpful.  The server had great suggestions for entrees.	3
	1369	"Went in for a men's haircut. $50.00 + mandatory $10.00 tip. I expected, at least, a high end  top notch haircut.....instead it looked like Edward Scissor Hands cut it. One side was cut at least an inch above the ear and the other side actually went over the ear. Horrible job. I asked for another stylist but guess what....the one that hacked it is the only one there for the next two days. So yes, I get to spend my time in Vegas with a complete disaster of a haircut. \n\nI am giving this a \""one star\"" because the staff was nice and respectful to my complaints and they did reimburse me."	0
	1370	Had an electrical fire today, after I got locked out of my house yesterday with a door malfunction, and the A/C has been out for 2 days now. But it's only 94 degrees in the house, so totally not too bad.	0
	1371	I'm a little embarassed to even be writing a review about Nickels, but here goes.\n\nWe stopped in here because it was freakin' freezing and raining outside and we needed brunch - pronto!\n\nWe all ordered crepes (not pancakes as our server was quick to point out)...duh, were English, not stupid.\n\nAnyway, we had the fruit crepes and the strawberry/nutella crepes.  I ordered a side of sausage with mine.\n\nFood was average, crepes were a bit greasy and the strawberry nutella crepe had an obscene amount of nutella.  It was frankly a bit nauseating.  Great for a 6 year old, but not at all what I expected.\n\nFood was reasonably price and the crepe portions sizes seemed a lot smaller than the greasier bacon/egg/potato combos.	1
	1372	I do miss Sunflower Market as there prices were a little bit cheaper than Sprouts. Nonetheless, it has not stopped me from shopping here as it is very convenient to where I live. The produce is always fresh and sometimes they have a sale that you just can't pass up. ( Case in point me buying 8lbs of strawberries for $7.97. Hey I freeze them and use them in my smoothies lol) \n\nAll in all not bad but again I still miss Sunflower Market and there cheaper prices!	3
	1373	Believe the hype.  This place is great!  I take every visitor we have to Cornish Pasty.  I have been here almost 10 times now and I am still finding new favorites on the menu.  All the Pasty's are awesome.  Even the pasta salad is great.  Great place!	4
	1374	I really enjoy the food! I had short ribs and calamari for apps and spicy noodles and Seabass.... Ambiance is fantastic!!!! Good cocktail menu as well	3
	1375	I stopped in here because it was nearby where I was shopping. I was in a rush & there was no wait. I got a acrylic full set, white tips. \nThe gentleman who did my nails put the tips on too high, so my actual nail line is visible under the acrylic. \nThere were also lots of bubbles and specks in the finished nail. I noticed he didn't brush the debris from my fingers after the drilling. \nI don't recommend this salon for anyone getting acrylic nails. No attention to details.	0
	1376	This place is a dump and the only good thing in there is the carve steakhouse. The buffet is disgusting and nasty. The clientele are lowlifes. The staff is terrible and so is the gaming. Avoid this place!!	1
	1377	Finally tried this place, after going to Chicago Tasty Dogs a few times, the one in Henderson by Target. Got tired of high prices and a dirty dining room, so thought I'd try Bono's on a friend's recommendation. Very good. The dogs are all Vienna. As an old guy told me, maybe the owner, everything on the dog was imported from Chicago, except the tomatoes, onions and mustard, which was French's. Prepared Chicago style: mustard, onions, relish, pickle spear, tomatoes, sport peppers and celery salt, all on a Vienna poppy seed bun. A dog and fries, just 3.99. \n\nI'll be back. ,	4
	1378	I have been a fan ofthis restaurant, and have recommended it to several people in the past, but had a horrible experience yesterday. I feel strongly enough about my experience that I joined yelp today just to review this restaurant. The food as always was excellent, but the overall experience was horrible. I figured I would avoid the usual long wait that always seems to be the way it is at this restaurant, so I called ahead. I ordered a whole fried chicken and the ribs and pork shoulder. I checked to make sure my order was right before leaving, but didn't think to actually count the chicken pieces. When I got home, I found there was only half a chicken. When I called to explain, I made what I thought were concrete plans to come back at 2 forthem to give me the other half chicken. Well, when I came at 2, no one even aknowledged that I was there for 15 minutes. no joke. I waited 15 minutes for anyone to even aknowledge I was there. When I was finally greeted by the same person who had taken my order initially, who had given me the food the first time, and who fielded my call when I called back, she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. So after explaining again I was told to wait again. At that point she started bringing out chicken for all trhe seated customers, and other to go orders. I was put at the bottom of the priority list, and literally waited another 10 minutes. I finally went to the back area, and asked for my $ back, and the general attitude was that I was being unreasonable. They handed me my half chicken, no apology, or explanation was given. I felt as if I was bothering them. It was a horrible experience, and it will be a while before I give them another chance. I am very understanding that mistakes hapopen, but feel a little more customer service would be in order especially since I've spent hundreds of dollars there over this past year... very very disappointed!	0
	1379	I have eaten here three times. Everyone always told me how amazing this place was so after trying it the first time (maybe about a year ago), and having a plain, tasteless meal, I figured maybe just a fluke or hopefully they have changed since then. I ate there about 2 months ago and again it was just blah. The third time did it for me when the food was not only gross and tasteless (AGAIN) but two people that work there that I dealt with were extremely rude! Never going back.	0
	1380	Based solely off of customer service- I live in Orlando, but my dad was having his birthday dinner at Nola's about a month ago. I called and spoke with a friendly girl and asked if I could send a drink to the birthday boys table and she was more than happy to assist me promptly. It was a busy night for them plus and unusual request so, I was pleased that she was so willing to help!	4
	1381	"I would not, could not, will not recommend this place. First, the store is kind of dirty and cramped for space. You are selling home improvement services and the least you can do is take some pride in your work space. I don't remember what the flooring in the shop looked like and that is kind of sad since they \""specialize\"" in carpet.\n\nThe main reason I can't or won't tell you to go here is the service. First, I paid them $20 cash to come measure my house. That $20 went straight into Steve's (the owner) wallet. (I should have known then). He did write a receipt... On a white piece of paper that he pulled out of the printer... Oh no! Then the night before he was to come and measure he called and asked \""what am I measuring for again?\"" Really? \n\nSo the day he measured he calls me at 10:15 and says he's running late because he stopped for breakfast... He was supposed to be there at 10. When he gets to the house he smokes a cigarette in his car then walks to the door and tells my wife... Sorry, traffic was really bad. He's here so I want to get my $20's worth... And hey, maybe the deal really is worth it! \n\nWhen he sees my wife's bird and proceeds to tell me how he used to smuggle birds when he was like 16... Again, why? Then he asks how long they live and tells my wife \""I'll bet you will be glad when he's gone\"" seriously, I think my wife will be devastated when her pet of 40 years passes away.  When WE actually get to the measuring part I have to hold the tape measure and remember all of the numbers for him... What did I pay you for again? During the measuring he keeps telling me I'm gonna save a lot of money because he's gonna use the waste carpet to do the closet, the stairs, etc... I'm not spending a few thousand dollars on \""waste\"" carpet. Way to market your product buddy!\n\n When he finally leaves he tells us to come in on Saturday to sign the contract and he'll give us a quote. Since we both work and aren't able to stop in over the weekend. I get a call on Monday by his assistant and I ask what the quote is. Am I ever surprised when he is $1400 more expensive than the 2 other places that we had come out and give us a quote. I let the assistant know that the price isn't competitive, thank him for his time and let him know that we are going to go with one of the other places. \n\nTuesday Steve calls. Tells me that he can save me a lot of money, but I have to give him a written copy of the quotes I received. Fair enough, but at this point he starts lecturing me on how I'm throwing away my money if I go with someone else. He's giving me $1400 in free padding... Even though his quote is $1400 more than anyone else... So I guess I'm paying for the padding in other ways. He then tells me that I didn't give him a fair chance to beat the other offers, even though I gave everyone 1 shot at my business. He didn't seem to understand that if you want to earn my business you need to put your best foot forward and give me your best price the first time. I Don't play the car game... Of course I also stopped to ask myself \""what if that was his best foot forward?\"". \n\nHe ended the call with \""when you need new tile call me and I will get you a deal\"". Yeah, maybe in 25 years when my wife's bird passes away! Bottom line, call A to Z at your own risk. The website says \""reputation is everything\""... I think this review serves as a good reference on said reputation. I don't see how this place stays in business."	0
	1382	This is my type of place. Err, atleast I thought it was. Pizza and beer and wings and hoagies? Word. (Insert chest bump).\n\nThe sandwiches turned out to be sub-par but the pizza was good and greasy, along with the wings. The beer was . . . well. . .  beer so I was ok with that. \n\nBut all in all it just didn't do it for me. I think a contributing factor is that I have a couple of lady friends who worked there that all resoundingly agreed that the management were skeezy douchebags. I guess it just made it hard to respect after that. Besides, there are lots of places to get Bud Light pitchers (that are overpriced anyway) and chomp on some average bar food.	2
	1383	NEVER EVER GO HERE!\n\nAwful customer service, simply dismal. Terrible attitudes... \n\nBecause of their attitudes I will never stay here again.\n\nPitiful.\n\n(ref other reviews, there are several that talk about bad customer service, this was NOT a one-time experience..)\n\nIf you want to be treated nice, and have a nice breakfast in a nice atmosphere take the sky walk to Palms Place and eat at Simons.	0
	1384	Unhappy about the hours. Change the yelp ad. You guys are closed Sunday! I drove all the way out to get my favorite food to find you are closed.... Common now!!	2
	1385	I love this place for breakfast.  I know it's not as big a breakfast buffet as other places, but it was better food.  I always enjoy eating here.  The servers are very nice and they refill my drinks promptly.  And, they also chat and make me feel special (I am sure they are trained to do this - but, they are trained well!).  I like the made-to-order omelets at the buffet, all the fruit, eggs. bacon, breads, hash browns - a really great small buffet.  I have also ordered from the menu (French toast) and it was good, too.  I have only eaten breakfast here so I can't comment on everything else.	3
	1386	uhhh...am i missing something? i've heard so much about the wynn buffet and how amazing it is but i was completely unimpressed!! \n\nmy friends and i paid $43.00 each for dinner and it was SO NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!\nthey have a wide selection of food to choose from but there wasn't anything really appealing...the food was either too salty, too bland or plain GROSS. the only thing i enjoyed was the brisket. \n\nnever. coming. here. again. -_______-	1
	1387	A nice place for lunch or dinner. However, on two occasions employees had brought children to work which is not a good idea at all.   The music is always a real pleasure--not loud or intrusive--very pleasant.  The food is good.	3
	1388	Having lived in the Northeast before moving to Arizona, this place reminded me of the attitude that was so common back in NJ/ NY.\n\nRude, arrogant, cold service. This is Arizona, Chase people! Lighten up a bit! Sheesh. Not coming back to this location.	0
	1389	Short Stack Eatery is open four days a week.  Every other restaurant on State Street is open at least six days a week.  How do they manage this? Easy: they jack up the prices.\n\nI ordered: eggs sunny side up, sourdough toast, potatoes, sausage, pancakes (yes, it was a big breakfast!), a bloody mary\n\nMy wife ordered: a breakfast burrito and a mimosa.\n\nThe total came to... over $45.  That's right: $45 for breakfast.  That's insane.  I might be ok with paying that price for the best breakfast I've ever had.  That's not what I got.\n\nThe good:\npancakes-- truly excellent.  Fluffy, flavorful, and served with a high quality maple syrup\n\nsourdough toast-- delicious!\n\nThe fine:\n- eggs were cooked just fine.  It's not like you can make brilliant sunny side up eggs.  You either make them right or screw them up.  They didn't screw them up.\n\nThe not fine:\n- The sausage links tasted fine, but they were TINY.  I've seen breakfast places serve links this size, but they've always come four to an order.  At Short Stack you get two.  Pathetic.\n\n- Potatoes: Absolutely flavorless\n\n- Breakfast burrito: delicious on the first bite.  Mushy and salty after that.\n\nThe absolutely disgusting\n- Bloody Mary: I love this drink, but this was by far the worst, most repulsive variation I have ever tasted.  It was pulpy, thick, and disgusting.  It came with an elaborate garnish that contained absolutely nothing that I actually wanted to eat.  And it somehow inexplicably costs ten dollars.  Seriously?Just thinking of this drink is making me gag. \n\nThe WTF?\n\n- it was about 90 degrees inside, so we ended up sitting outside in late October.\n\n- The waitress brought the food and drinks.  I asked for tobasco sauce to kill the nastiness of the bloody.  She told me to go inside to the self service bar.  Are you kidding me? Did I just not pay $45 friggin' dollars for breakfast? How about you grab the goddamn bottle of Tobasco sauce and bring it to me?\n\nWhy does this location seem to attract total amateurs who don't have a clue about running a restaurant?  First T Sushi and now this bullshit.	1
	1390	I was very disappointed in Social House on my second visit. I first went this past Thursday evening and ordered the Sashimi platter. It was very delicious - very fresh fish, real wasabi, and great service. It was so good that we went back for another meal on Sunday evening. This time, it was a completely opposite experience. \n\nWe ordered the sashimi platter again, but this time the fish was not fresh at all. The cut of tuna sashimi that they served was not only not fresh, but also a horrible cut with tendon and very chewy. I had a stomach ache after for an hour or so. \n\nWe also ordered two of the modern sashimi platters - one with Yellowtail and the other with albacore. It was obvious that it was not freshly made as the server brought it out literally 1 minute later, and it tasted like they just took it out of the fridge. Gross. \n\nWhen I asked why the fish was not fresh, the server just gave me some not relevant BS answer about how the fish is flown in from Alaska. Horrible service!\n\nI don't know what happened social house, but I was sorely very disappointed after many positive visits by my friends and I. We will not be back.	0
	1391	"Raspberry Lambic.   Did you hear me?  Raspberry Lambic?  It's a burger joint with all the class and style of a downtown jazz club located in a strip mall across the street from a gelato shop.  It's a marriage of convenience to an ugly girl who really knows how to work it.  \n\nThe best things about Delux are its burgers and fries.  The fries, sweet potato and regular, are crisp, salty and delicious.  They are served in miniature shopping carts with the D for Delux emblazoned on the front.  Our server adorably quipped \""Fries A La Cart.\""  Heh...heh....ehhhhh.....they still tasted good. \n\nThe burgers are properly cooked to order and the meat is flavorful and satisfying.   I've been twice now and have yet to be disappointed.   My only beef (pun intended) with Delux is the lack of 1000 island dressing for my burger (I'm white trash like that).   However, the aioli which is spicy but still smooth makes up for the lack of 1000 as a substitute condiment.   \n\nThe beer list is extensive and the menus are adorable.  The outside patio is misted and looks out onto a nice view...well, for a road-side strip mall at least.  If you go during peak hours, expect a wait.   It's reasonably priced but still a $15/head trip."	4
	1392	I like PHX airport.\n\nI find it easy to get through and logically laid out.\nBaggage is simple and I like that you can be picked up at each of the 4 Terminals instead of having to take a train to a main one.\n\nI wish they had a few better eateries, but, hey, it's an airport.\n(Is there some kind of law that requires airports to provide shitty, over-priced food?)\n\nOverall, an easy place to navigate.	4
	1393	I just moved to Charlotte, so I've been shopping at ALL reasonably priced furniture stores: VCF, IKEA, Furniture Row, Ashley Furniture, etc. I found that Value City offers... well the best value for their prices. I bought a wonderful stylish sleeper sofa for $599, a chic bed for around $400, and a great stone top dining set for six for $299. I am pretty picky on terms of style and quality, and I am very happy with my purchases!\n\nThis store in particular has a good variety, but look online too because I noticed that it gets updated more frequently. When I came in the store to make a purchase, the sofa that I wanted went off of sale online just a couple days before, but they still gave me $100 discount!\n\nMy sales person was Karen who was very nice and helped me get the discount. One part of the drawer on the bed was missing when I received it but they ordered another for me immediately. Overall, I really liked the prices and the service, and I'm definitely coming back for other furniture!	4
	1394	2 coffees, 1 power aide, 3 bacon and egg croissants $33.25. Way pricey and the food was not much to speak of, but we were concerned we would miss our flight, and this eatery is conveniently adjacent to d52-59 Gates.\n\nTry to eat before getting to the airports or try another restaurant.	1
	1395	"Ordered three plates: (1) yellowtail \""tiradito\"" - very good (loved the fried string sweet potatoes with it. The portion was very small (only three pieces), (2) white ceviche - decent, but had better, (3) Heirloom tomato salad with mozzarella ice cream- tasty.  Overall, the food is good, but portion is very small and it's pricey. I know it's a tapas place, but I've had bigger portions at other tapas place."	2
	1396	So the area around this IHOP is a little shady and full of meth zombies and losers, that being said there's no real reason to venture down there anyways. And there's usually some bum or drug addict standing around asking you for change when you leave the restaurant too. However the food and service are great. Especially the SIMPLE & FIT Blueberry Harvest Grain 'N Nut\u00ae Combo	2
	1397	Buyer beware. \n\nI had stayed here before through a corporate booking, and had gotten a great room that opened on to a nice courtyard. Since that visit, I had been looking forward to staying here again, as Scottsdale is a hub for my corporation, and my team and I meet here about 4 times a year. \n\nThis time, here for pleasure with friends, I spotted a deal on Hotels.com, which the ValleyHo gladly matched (upon verification) saving me about $20/night. And that's where the good news ends, and the trouble begins...\n\nAs soon as we checked in, the staff referenced the Hotels.com price and they gave us a room on the street (complete with traffic noise) in a building as far afield from the main building as they could find. The room was down a dark interior cooridor, and rougher around the edges than I had remembered, with a broken coffee maker, noisy air-conditioner, and faded decor. One might suspect that we landed in this far-flung room because the hotel was full, but alas, it was half empty and we still got shafted on the room. \n\nWe stayed for breakfast (which was good) and a quick dip in the pool (crowded by 10a, but then again it is the desert) and then checked out. At the tail end of our stay, we traded in the ValleyHo for the Hilton, and were treated better for it. Sad to say goodbye to one of the 'hipper' hotels in Scottsdale, but I will unless they upgrade their service.	1
	1398	This is the place where they used to host the old Charlotte Hornets practice sessions back in the day.  Well, now it hosts a slew of concerts and other events on the basketball court.  I thought that the acoustics of this place could have been better.  Also I am a bigger fan of the open floor, so the fans can move around and dance to the music.  At the concert that I went to there was some space at the front of the court, but it got pretty damn crowded and people behind us got kind of urked about the people standing in front of them.  It is a rock show for God's sakes, stand up!  Anyways the good thing about this place was that you can get a pretty good view of the stage from any where in the center; I would still rather catch a show at a smaller place.	2
	1399	Food was great. Service at a table was fine in a previous visit. But in the bar, it didn't seem like a priority for wait staff to take orders and tend to customers dining in the bar area. Ended up taking longer than it took for many others to get seated and waited on in the restaurant dining area. So the deduction in stars is sure to that lack of service level in the bar area.	2
	1400	Charter is exactly why monopolies are illegal.\nI moved from an apartment in Madison and will admit, had financial troubles leading me to be late in a couple payments. Whenever I tried to call to make a payment, I would get a message saying that I was current on my account. After hours and countless phone calls and being bounced back and forth from representative to representative, it turned out they had fucked up their accounting. They had been applying my payments to another account and the new tenant of my old apartment's payments to my account. I ended up having to fax them my personal banking statements to prove I had made payments when I told them I had. \nThey ended up sending my account to a collection agency and fucking up my credit. \nThanks a lot Charter.	0
	1401	Two words: nutella latte. And a few more words: even better 1/2 sweet with almond milk. Oh, and: alien burrito. But seriously, I really like Sunrise Coffee. \n\nIt's a quaint little hipster joint in the middle of nowhere on Sunset but it's well worth the trek cause let's be honest, no one lives around where it's located.  The menu offers plenty of options for coffee beverages and foods. They are able to make most items regular, vegetarian, or vegan. So everybody wins!\n\nThe alien burrito is seriously addicting. Coming from a meat and rice girl, I love this dish and am fully satisfied with everything in it. It's just deliciousness wrapped up in a red or green tortilla.\n\nThis place has spoiled me though. Because their lattes are so good, it's hard to order a latte elsewhere now because you know it just won't be as good as the Sunrise lattes.\n\nSo if you're in the area and want some yummy coffee or food, or even if you aren't, Sunrise Coffee won't disappoint.	4
	1402	I really try not to give people gifts that I actually want for myself, it's just that my taste in all things is so damn good, I can't help but feel they too will lust after the same things I do. Which is why my husband ended up with a white Holga last Christmas. If you're unfamiliar, it's a toy film camera from China with a cult following among photo nerds due to its completely unpredictable results. The good news is he loved it and it's lots of fun to play with. The bad news is you have to actually go to a store to buy specialty film (medium format, we usually go with 120).\n\nI have been familiar with Tempe Camera since I was a wee community college girl, taking Photo classes at MCC. Back then, you could (I'm pretty sure, though I've put my brain cells through a lot in 10 years) buy film and also get it processed there. Now, they only sell cameras/accessories and film (they also rent and repair cameras and equipment). On my first trip back in several years, I came armed with a sheet of paper of all the 120 format film I was going to test out in my (ahem ... my HUSBAND's) new camera. B&W, color, 800 speed, 200 speed, I was ready to try it all. Too bad they only had ONE brand of medium format color film and only in one speed (Kodak Vivid Color 400) and two B&W speeds (200 and 400 in FUJI) available. And I'm pretty sure I got the very last roll of color they had on hand with no more on their way (I asked if they had some coming in soon or not). I'm sure 120 film isn't a huge seller, but I certainly hoped a specialty camera store for professionals would have a moderately well-stocked selection. I've returned about four more times to buy more 120 film and it's usually about the same selection.\n\nAs for their customer service, I've never had a problem. They could be a tad friendlier and it would have been great if they offered suggestions or tips on films for the Holga, especially when I kept asking for films they didn't have (for all I know, I'm a dum dum and the films I wanted look like crap with a Holga, and the ones they keep stocked work the best with these cameras). I can't speak to their film prices since I wouldn't even know where else to get medium format film (except online and the prices there seem comparable once you factor shipping). So in conclusion, for my needs they a-ok.	2
	1403	I had previoulsy reserved a car for a weekend here with no real issue. They picked me up at my work right on time with no mention of distance from my work to their office location (4.77 miles)\nThough there is one or two locations closer to my work, this one isn't far, and is close to my home (exactly 2 miles), and has better prices since it is slightly further away from the airport than other options.\nWhile in the car I had rented, I was pulled over, though not sighted, for expired tags (this is the second time this has happened in a car rented from Enterprise, though the first from a location in Los Angeles).\nThe employee that assisted me upon returning my car credited me for a day for the hassle. Based on this experience, I would have given a 4 star, maybe even 5 star review.\nThis last time I used them is why it is a one star review.\nI again made a reservation and called to confirm and requested a pick up. I provided the address and was told no problem. I also advised that I did not receive my reward points from my last rental and asked to be given the agreement number so I could request the points online. I was told no, I have to come into the office to do that.\nAt 4:22pm I received a call saying they were on their way, perfect, I get off at 4:30. At 4:34 I get a second call, which I assumed was to tell me that they were ready for me, but no, it was another call telling me they were just leaving. So finally at 5 I arrive....AT A DIFFERENT OFFICE.\nMy reservation had been transferred to another location without asking me, telling me or even checking with that office to see if they had any cars in the size I requested. I didn't know I had been transferred until I was half way there and asked where I was being taken (it was the opposit direction of where I was expecting to go).\nThey did not have any economy cars, because they didn't know they needed to have one ready! I was informed they had a Ford Focus available but it was more expensive since it was a midsize with leather interior. I informed the person helping me that I made reservations for a specific price, I had called and confirmed a car would be available, I did not request the transfer, and it was August in Phoenix, if I had the choice I would NOT get a car with black leather interior. So after making me wait several minutes he came back and made it seem like he was doing me such a big favor by honoring the price I had on my reservation (that I had printed out and brought with me).\nSo in the end, I got a car and at the price I wanted but the customer service and communication was definitely lacking. I may need to rethink where I rent cars from in the future.	0
	1404	Unfortunately I didn't have a great experience. It's definitely in a good location and the place is pleasantly decorated but I'm not happy with my haircut. I bought a picture with me with the haircut I wanted and didn't get the result. It's shorter than I wanted and it looks and feels heavy. The name of the stylist was Erika not sure if it was a junior or senior stylist but from the results I would say inexperienced. I also got a blow out which was poorly done as well. Frizz everywhere and not straight on some parts and in the picture I showed it was straight mine was styled more towards the inside. It's unfortunate since I'm definitely looking for a permanent stylist.	0
	1405	Very blah. The cesear dressing tasted like mayonnaise. The food didn't haven't much flavor. I would highly recommend Olive Garden over Bravo.	0
	1406	Everyone raves about this place and yet I am still trying to figure out why? No offense but they really do put on way too much frosting on their cupcakes and my mom makes way better cupcakes. Don't get me wrong, for those of you that love this place, by all means enjoy, plus they are very charitable, however these cupcakes just are not on my top fav list.	1
	1407	Great place!  Monica at the bar was extremely attentive, Nicole was terrific at the table everything was spot on!  Had the Guac and chips which were great, then a spinach salad and short rib with the egg.  The short rib could have used a touch more sauce but all and all everything was very good.  My friend had the chicken and also thought it was the shit.  The restaurant was cosy with the fireplace and well dressed milf's prancing around.  Just how I remembered it =)  party on!	4
	1408	"Greg Knutsons was hired and paid to patch a hole in my stucco. 1st visit looked terrible, built up so high there was a huge lump, and it was crumbling off. called him back he attempted again it crumbled off on outside edges as it was painted and it still looked no better. this is the third and final repair \""his words he wont be doing anymore on it, this is as good as it gets\"" and at this point he was very rude. he does not stand behind his work, and offered no refund so that I could have a professional do it. hes not a licensed contractor, and check the better business bureau.he claims bbb, and is not. dont use him,you are wasting your money as I did. please feel free to contact me if any questions. the picture is attatched to his page of what he left my wall looking like."	0
	1409	Thanks again to the ladies working Sat 10/19/14. It's rare to find one employee that is willing to help when not related to a sale but ALL of the employees stepped up when I lost my purse. They checked their tape and let me know I didn't have it when I entered the store which helped me locate where I had left it. I will forever be grateful for the compassion they showed me and will be buying all my linens from Anna's from now on. You ladies are a great team!	4
	1410	The LVH what was the HILTON, yes the Hotle is old and needs work but nothing beats the VIP service when i arrived on a friday and there were lots of people standing in line to check in maybe a 100 or so i went to the VIP room got my room in minutes and the people were still in line. The Hotel needs to add more slots not remove more for dancing this is one bad decision. There was a day i would never leave the hotle and play all day for days at a time, but now i go to the monorail and go to other casinos and i do enjoy this new experience now. I had a great time went to the MMA match had front row seats took lots of pic's met some very nice people. The next night i went to the Rich Little show my VIP comp got me front row seats again and just loved the show Rich Little the master of voices he had me rolling in the aisles a must see cant wait to go back and see this show agian. I met Steve Rossi and told him how much i enjoyed the show im hoping to see this show at The LA MIRADA  THEATRE . I critique musical's, movie's, fine dinning, hotel's and event's so im always networking. I went to my favorit Steak House TJ'S  and had a great dinner, porterhouse, salad and dessert just fabulous i talked to Iralee ( manager ) and Cheryl two wounderful ladie's. The parking is the best thing at this hotel yes it is full but if one gets a spot its right in back of the hotel im handicapped, The Paradise cafe is great for brunch and so is the buffet. I had the pleasure of meeting Max and Jojo this little dog ( jojo ) will take pic's  with you i just love this little guy. I stayed at 5 casinos this trip and was on a 15 day tour, I freelance on facebook so no pay. But i love what i do.	3
	1411	I had asked a co-worker for a good steakhouse in the area and Johnny's was suggested highly.\n\nWell, I was sorely disappointed with the food. The service was okay.\nThe drunkin steak was over cooked(asked for med-rare, got medium). The broccoli was slightly mushy. The best thing about the plate was the garlic sauce under the steak and it made the steak edible.\n\nI will not suggest Johnny's to anyone.	0
	1412	ok...not that good, not horrible.   First I had no cash and got charged $1.50 to use my Visa debit card so my 'lunch special' that was $6.99 ended up being $13 with a drink.\nPortions were small,  bean were a bit watery.  Had two carne asada tacos, not much flavor and the steak was cut in to big chunks, not normal for Carne Asada from my experience.  Tortillas seemed store bought and fell apart while eating.  There you have a honest review.  will add a pic.	1
	1413	"My mother and I went to this sad, sad shop a few months ago after I had my son. The girl behind the counter was anything but friendly, and stared at me and my baby like we were carrying the plague. They only had 4 flavors of cupcakes, 3 of which were basic flavors that were so laden with frosting that I couldn't believe it! After receiving such terrible customer service that my mom and I didn't even want to try Cupcakes anymore, we thought \""Eh, we're here anyway...\"" and we bought 4- one for each person at home. The cake was nothing to write home about and the fact that there was about 1/2 cup of frosting on my cupcake was quite suspicious. Maybe they were making up for sweetness in frosting for what the very cranky counter girl lacked? Definitely not worth how much they charge and would rather get my cupcake fix elsewhere."	0
	1414	I love this place. Go here once a week and I always have a good experience. It has what I need and always for a good price. It's a good environment too, save for the stray uppity snob or Walmart pedestrian. I can deal with them. I always have a great experience here.	4
	1415	Had great service at lunch today! Shout out to Ruth: a real professional.\n\nArrived a little past two and was looking forward to the jalape\u00f1o pecan pancakes but Ruth --after trying to see if there was any chance to stop the kitchen before it was too late -- informed us that the breakfast set up had already been torn down and we would be limited to lunch. Disappointing, but absolutely understandable. I appreciated her 1) driving at our table so quickly after being seated and 2) noticing we were looking at the breakfast menu and redirecting us before we could get too far down the road to disappointment.\n\nThe best thing about lunch at Orange Table is the cocktail menu! Granted, you could get one with breakfast but they're the real highlight at lunch. I'm a fan of the ginger drinks but today I went with a refreshing strawberry, gin mojito called Glasglow ($9). \n\nIn lieu of the pancakes, I had the California Tuna. The concept is FABULOUS and has the potential to be as big of a hit as those killer pancakes for me, but the tuna was weak on flavor.  \n\nThere were problems from the kitchen (no egg on a nicoise salad, pieces of tuna that were difficult to bite through); still, I'm looking forward to future visits and, hopefully, continuing to up my rating!	2
	1416	Dr. Schanel himself is wonderful, a delight and most excellent at what he does. I give him 5 stars. \n\nUnfortunately, the fellow working the reception desk the last few years is what earns the low rating. His customer service skills are a detriment to Dr. Schanel and his business, and doing Dr. Schanel's good reputation and excellence a huge disservice.\n\nI've been going to Dr. Schanel for over 17 years and no longer find the struggle of dealing with the office guy worth it. His passive aggressive demeanor, lack of follow through, and ego get in the way of providing acceptable customer service. \n\nThis has not been just my experience, as I've observed desk dude in action with other customers in person and on the phone, and have come across 3 other folks who have had similar experiences- also former long-time patrons of the establishment.\n\nSomeone as the face of a business should enjoy or be patient with customer interaction and relations, with a good dose of humility and genuine kindness, or desire to help.\n\nThe office guy with his derisive, sour attitude would be better suited to work at the D.MV.	1
	1417	"Talk about a woman who knows the meaning of the word boudoir. Jodi is excellent at what she does. Having \""sexy\"" photos taken is not an easy thing for most women, and for some of us, it just doesn't come naturally. Jodi has a way of making you feel comfortable in your own skin and sexy. Before you know it, the photo shoot is over and she has captured some incredible photos that you didn't even think you were capable of taking.  The experience  for me was priceless! Jodi and her staff made me feel like a girly girl, pretty, sexy and confident. Pictures may fade in time, but that experience I will have for a life time. Thank you so much!\n We love our photo book and could not be more pleased with the entire experience. Jodi is an amazing photographer and artist, as well as reliable and efficient. Highly recommend!"	4
	1418	Not worth $25 per person for burger and fries. \nWe went to try is because it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. \nWe had to wait 30 mins to be seated, the place was not even full. \nWe were given water, them asked if we wanted something else to drink besides water. We sat for 30 mins with only water. \nOrdered appetizers and our meals. About 30 mins later we got an order of fries, asked which ones they were, the gal had NO idea what they were. Then more fries came out, I said they were to come with the meal and we ordered apps, the server came over and said sorry I forgot to put the app order In, after she told us they would be out in a few mins. So our apps came after our meals came. \nWe were never asked if we wanted more drinks. \nThe fastest thing to come was the bill. We were never offered desert.\n$150 for 6 people is ridiculous for burgers and fries. Food was ok, service sucked.	0
	1419	It was very nice they are offering 1/2 pizza at this time during lunch. We started with calimari, fresh,and good breading, a little salty. My friends margarita pizza was soso.\nMy pizza with sausage and mushrooms, was undercooked. hopefully the next time it will be better.  The service was fine, except that they had to recook my pizza, and it arrived 10 minutes after the other orders.  The decor is OK.	1
	1420	This is my first time to Steep & Brew. I got a caramel latte, iced (I'm a child of the suburbs, give me a break) \n\nOn first impulse, it seems like the espresso isn't the greatest, or at least in comparison to Starbucks down the street. \n\nOn the other hand, it seems like a place that's a lot easier to study than Starbucks. It's much less clustered and busy, which is big if you're trying to do some reading. \n\nI'd rather give this place a 3.5/5 than just a 3/5, but it's closer to a 3 than a 4 for me. \n\nAlso, if you're in the mood for some soft-rock slow jams, this is your joint.	2
	1421	Tried to purchase some DJ equipment from this company. My order was denied because my billing address for my credit card was different from my shipping address. Really?! I run several companies and have never run into to this. One of my companies the billing address is our PO Box and the mailing address is the store front or what if I wanted to send a gift to someone? I obviously can't do it through Full Compass.  Also why do you offer the option of a alternate billing or mailing address? Doesn't make sense especially in this economy. I'll be sure to send along my $600+ receipt from the company that's okay with a different mailing address.	0
	1422	Meh? First time here and it looked decent from the outside,  outside of that the place is  very underwhelming. Sketchy, unwelcoming service. When J asked to rub a tab they took my name, credit card and drivers license? Bartender(a) seemed to have a different agenda.	0
	1423	Good stuff here! Good Sangria!  We went here for dinner on a Friday evening and found a table relatively quickly. Chicken enchilada was pretty good and really don't have any complaints about the place.  Service and food were good. Would return.	2
	1424	We had dinner here tonight for our Anniversary and I think it's my new favorite restaurant.  The atmosphere is one of the nicest we've seen in Phoenix - not the typical Scottsdale restaurant. We had a table in the courtyard and it was beautiful and intimate. The place is upscale but not pretentious.  Loved the food!  They have a 4 course meal and you have the option of a wine pairing, which we did.    This restaurant is a must try!	4
	1425	Talk at work had me checking this place out. Great selection, friendly staff, and quality product. Superior to dunkin' donuts, but for a plain glazed, a fresh, hot krispy kreme still rules.	3
	1426	"I have never been to a Firehouse Subs. I am from NJ and know my fair share of good quality subs, my hometown aside this review is based on hot subs which is not a \""NJ\"" trade. \n\nThis place just opened up, I heard great things about their meatball sub. We ordered 3 subs including a meatball sub, cheese steak and a hot turkey and ham. Wasn't a fan of the fact that you can not watch your sandwhiches being made like other sub shops. Expected a longer wait since they are brand new, no problem. Came home, set the table and opened our bag. The three different subs were not labeled accordingly just with a #1, 2, or 3. Opened all three and found NO meatball sub. Instead we received another hot deli sub of three different meats. \n\nThe bread is spongey and blah, wasn't toasted just warm. The cheese steak meat was minced, the melted cheese was just baked into the soft bread. The other two had zero flavor besides the overwhelming amount of mayo. Three medium subs, three bags of chips for $24. Seriously could have made a ham, turkey and cheese sub on crappy sub rolls from Frys and just microwaved it. \n\nSo disappointed. Was hoping for at least a decent dining option in Maricopa that was not Mexican. I would rather drive out of town to Jersey Mikes or Jimmy Johns, the sandwhich would probably be just as hot by the time I got home. \n\nPerhaps it would have been better had we received the meatball sub we ordered. I'm not even sure I will go back to try that."	1
	1427	With a rocky start with our server not coming, I went to the manager to get us a server to wait on us.  We were waited on by Aisha, she was excellent, I don't know why our original sever didn't wait on us but they missed out on a 20% tip.  Thank you Aisha.  The atmosphere and food is what you would expect. The manager rectified the problem immediately with the sever that never showed.  Try the pumpkin cheesecake, it was excellent.	2
	1428	What have you changed?  I usually love Zoe's but today not so much.  The coleslaw tasted funny, the chicken was dry and even the lettuce seemed hot from the AZ sun.  Oh, and if you're not going to cut the chicken breast anymore buy some heavier weight cutlery so you can actually cut the chicken.	1
	1429	Dr. Hui is an incredible doctor. He is very knowledgable. He explains everything and answers all questions. He saw me as an emergency and did not charge me. He wrote a letter for my employer when I was having an eye problems. He is always pleasant and kind. He goes above and beyond for his patients. I have been going to Dr. Hui for several years and happy to pay out of insurance network to continue to see him. His prices are very reasonable. i can not say enough about how great he is.	4
	1430	I visit this restaurant frequently, as it is the closest Asian restaurant to my residence. Aside from the convenient location, I enjoy this place because of its good food. Their Chinese dishes are tasty and their sushi is fresh. This is not the place to go for a gourmet meal, but it is a step above your average Asian carryout. \n\nThe restaurant is clean and well kept. Staff are friendly and inviting. This place is consistent in their service and taste. Highly recommended for dining in or carryout.	3
	1431	"Despite living in LA, I've actually never been to the LA location and only to this one in Vegas. However, because of all the Mexican food I've eaten since being in LA, I'm feeling more and more confident about my ability to judge the cuisine.\n\nFor a chain, this place is not half bad. I had the carne asada taco plate with comes with rice and beans. I have to say, I enjoyed the tacos. The meat was flavored well and topped with some nice pico de gallo. The rice and beans were another matter. The beans were downright gross and obviously mushed up canned beans. Blech. No thanks. The rice was also dry and bland. I'd stick to just eating the tacos. \n\nAnother good thing? The drinks. Lots and lots of options and they do have a particularly delicious selection of margaritas. \n\nThe bad thing? The prices. They are ridiculously overpriced for Mexican food. My taco plate was like $13 for three tacos and crap beans and rice. There is barely anything that costs less than that and nothing is that good that it's worth paying more. \n\nMy advice? Drink the beer, drink the margaritas, and maybe have an appetizer but otherwise your money is better spent elsewhere (perhaps on a \""Pink Taco\"" t-shirt that you can giggle at? Ha...)"	2
	1432	We were very much looking forward to eating here. We had the chef's cooking at the Alchemy meal at the Bigelow Grille.We loved it there. Sorry to see him leave. So we were excited about trying Salt. The drink special was horrible.....I sent it back. Not drinkable. They still charged me for it. The cheese plate was good....but no bread or crackers available. Odd. Beet salad was unique with the poached egg. Duck was good, but fatty. The short ribs were VERY fatty. We looked forward to dessert: a choice of ONE. We left hungry and unhappy, and over $100 poorer. Our waitress did not offer us the meal descriptions like the other waitstaff. The chef is a great cook.....we know from his alchemy skills. Please bring it back!	0
	1433	Excellent food great fresh fish and fun environment ! Had the ceviche, pulled pork tacos,shrimp tacos and ahi tuna. Will Definetly come back	3
	1434	Love this place! Has the freshest tasting juice that is cold pressed and knowledgeable people to help you with a cleanse or just a kick start to a healthier life!  I spent quite some time there the other day just talking with Alexandra!  I came in just before closing and wanted to start a cleanse the next day.  They were basically out of juices so instead of having me come back when they opened the next day, she told me to just come back later that night when they were done juicing and she would help me pick out juices to make a great cleanse!  Needless to say, all of their juices taste amazing!  It's kind of pricey, but definitely worth it!	4
	1435	We paid a visit to Lucky Strike Las Vegas on a hot Saturday afternoon.  Assured by the hostess that the bowling alley would get packed on Saturday afternoons, we made a reservation in advance.  When we got there, the bowling alley was fairly empty.  We had no trouble getting a couple of lanes, but I was somewhat disappointed by the pseudo-deception.\n\nOne thing that I did really like about the operation was that the scores automatically carried over between games.  On the other hand, the selection of bowling ball weights was not very expansive.\n\nWhen we were walking by later on in the evening, the bowling lanes did not seem super busy at that time either.\n\nOverall, not bad, but nothing to rave about.	2
	1436	Came here for lunch while the woman had pho down the street.  Ends up the pho at Pho Kim Long was not to her liking.  Anyways, ordered the AYCE deal at the lunch price (cheaper than dinner).  Sushi and rolls were pretty good considering AYCE and less than $20 and it includes ice cream.  Place was busy so I felt like the wait to get my orders was a bit long. Overall, I was very pleased.  I was so hungry and craved sushi.  Why do I oftentimes eat only one meal a day when I'm in Vegas?  If I had gone to a regular sushi joint and ordered the same amount of food, my bill would be about a $100 (5 times what I paid here).  Would I come back?  Most likely but I definitely want to try the other AYCE joints here in Vegas first.	3
	1437	So disappointing. Not only did the service take forever, the meat was dry, the corn was dry, the buns were dry. It's unfortunate. Last time we were here, it was great. Not sure what happened, but we won't be back.	0
	1438	Amazing food! I'm a bit surprised that other people have reviewed the service as being poor. Maybe I happened to get a great waiter. If the owners/managers for Hecho reads this, I just want you to know that Dana was a fantastic waiter. If you order the guacamole, they make it right at your table and it was so damn good!\n\nNow to be fair, I don't have a lot of experience with non-Taco Bell Mexican food so I don't know if the food is objectively amazing or not. But I loved it. The portions were generous.	3
	1439	I've been several times, food always great. Something good happened with friendly service. Noticeable difference and nice! Bink is really special! Thanks! Fried Chicken and fries. Really great.	4
	1440	"He took some photos of my son, and I never received them.  I left him several messages before he ever called me back, and when he did his attitude couldn't have been any more rude.  He claimed he delivered them, and treated me like I was owed nothing.  I ended up asking for my money back, and told him to forget about the pictures.  We'll see if I get it back.  He did offer to reprint the pics, and send them a few weeks later.  When I asked him why it would take a few weeks his response was \""do you want them or not?\"".  I just don't do business with people who treat customers like this.  I hope you don't either.\n\nI would never use him again!"	0
	1441	"Are you kidding me? My first time back to jack in the box in a long time and guess what? They messed up the order, AGAIN!\n\nWent in for a quick snack, ordered our food and didn't have to wait too long for our order to arrive. As the expediter person was reading off what was in the bag, they realized they forgot an order of hash browns, which was readily fixed. Heading home, we divvied up the food and realized they forgot my main sandwich. \n\nI called, now 7-10 minutes after we had left the restaurant and the lady who answered the phone said, \""Oh that's where this sandwich was supposed to go, they just handed it to me.\"" Are you kidding me? As soon as I hung up the call, realized they made my wife's sandwich wrong too. They were not busy at all, there is no excuse for this many mistakes, except for incompetence."	0
	1442	I was lucky enough to try the kim chi fried rice when a friend brought it home to go. So after nearly a year of anticipating the fusion goodness, My BF and I ventured to the other side of town and ordered the Bulgogi Fries and Kim Chi fried rice with chicken. \n\nIt's a hole in the wall shop that boasts flavors and service very unmatching with the decor, It got pretty busy and the food that was laid out on either side of us looked and smelled amazing. \n\nI can't wait to go back!	3
	1443	We love the card tables at bellagio.  Pierre is an awesome and entertaining dealer.  We come to play here every time	4
	1444	I LOVE DELUX!! This is the kind of restaurant I have been dreaming of. I always crave some quality food at late hours and Filberto's and McDonald's does NOT seem to cut it. The burgers are high quality and cooked to perfection, also the bread is amazing. I'm not a huge fan of bleu cheese and it's on the Delux burger so sometimes I will just substitute it for some Monterrey jack or American cheese. The mixed (regular & sweet potato) fries are a MUST! They come with an addicting aioli sauce that I always need extra to spread on my burger. Since the burger is so huge I always split with the manfriend. To top off a great meal we get the black and white milkshake which is vanilla with fudge (BOMB.COM). Regardless of the amazing food, the service is impeccable. My bf was super thirsty and was joking that the waiter would not be be able to keep up with his light speed water drinking. Well, sure enough, the waiter was crazy on top of it the whole meal. HAD to tip big--he was amazing. I will be sure to remember his name next time and update this review with props to him.	4
	1445	"I already love everything about all Trader Joe's, so I won't delve into the minutiae about all that is wonderful about this store - I had a great \""customer service\"" experience at this location today that makes me love this grocery chain even more.\n\nI like to make my own Micheladas at home, and when I lived in LA, an employee at the Trader Joe's in Hollywood recommended a beer and the store brand Bloody Mary mix as my base, which I've always been happy with. But an employee at this location recommended a different beer (after my purchase), and sold me a single (even though it's only sold in 6-packs) of his recommendation, and I like it even more! All the employees at this location are always helpful, friendly, and go the extra mile."	4
	1446	I contemplated between steak street tacos and a steak burrito. The street tacos were fresh and delicious. The chips were fresh and light. It came with a side of refried beans covered in cheese. They were yummly. But if your hungry go with the burrito. Lots of fresh menu options and I will be back.	3
	1447	I was so excited when I realized there was a close place to home to drop off my pre-paid for postal packages a few months ago. The Lady seemed really nice the first day, but as I continued to come by and drop packages she became uninterested in even raising her head to say hello back to me.  I just thought she was probably grumpy for some other reason...but then 2 days ago I drop off 5 packages.  All of these were pre-paid Priority tracking. Yesterday 3 of the packages show up on the tracking system but 2 of them don';t.  Again today I check the tracking and these same 2 packages are still not being tracked. So I figure I'll go visit her and see if they fell out of the box or misplaced before I contact the post office.  She keeps her drop off box in an open area where you drop your own parcels (That way she doesn't have to be bothered).  When I asked very politely, she grumbles with her back to me that I need to take my grievance up with USPS cause she's not RESPONSIBLE. OK...lost my trust right there. Too easy for someone to grab parcels from the box...her back is almost always turned, and she lets off an air that she is just to busy to deal with you.  After contacting the post office they insisted that the carrier only got 3 packages not 5.  \nAs far as Jewelry,a few months ago she said I should talk to her husband in regards to fixing an expensive diamond pendant, she said, he'll take real good care of you.  Yeah, for 75.00. I just thought for such a small thing it was pricey.  I got it fixed for 12.00 at the indoor swapmeet and it's perfect. Since the day I said No, too expensive, I've gotten nothing but the cold shoulder from her. These 2 lost packages will cost me 75.00 and I am not happy about that.  If they are not responsible for your mail.....why would you go there?  If she's too busy to maintain integrity and the safety of our parcels maybe she should slow down on her additional hobbies of selling Handbags and Avon and concentrate more on her store.	0
	1448	"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. We went here for downtown pub crawl in search of the $1 drinks that had been prominently advertised. By $1 drinks, they actually meant $1 off overpriced glasses of shitty wine (with the \""discount,\"" Beringer White Zinfandel was only $7.50!). We made the mistake of asking Jason, the douchebag of a manager, to either honor the printed special or do *something* to make it worth our while to have gone there. Instead, Jason not only turned away our party of eight without offering any kind of special to make up for the false promise of $1 drinks, but also  gave us attitude for trying to take advantage of the pub crawl specials.  I don't think I've ever felt less welcome anywhere I've been."	0
	1449	So I hope the food is good because the service sucks. I sat down for a to go order. It took 20 minutes to place my order and another 25 minutes to get it. One waitress and one cook. All the tables were dirty and there were only Five other people in the place. Don't be in a hurry.	0
	1450	I went to Old Navy with the kids to buy some stuff. They didn't find much stuff. But the people that work there are really nice and make sure that you get the sale price when there's a sale on the item. It looks like my kids have kind of graduated from Old Navy so I don't see too many return trips in the future. That manikin entourage as you walk into the store was a little freaky in my opinion. What do you think? Check out the photo.	2
	1451	My wife and I both ordered Turkey burgers and she hated it. I thought it was just ok but they brought me watery bbq sauce with it and that sucked. Too many places in Vegas to eat that are incredible... avoid if possible	1
	1452	My girlfriend and I went here for breakfast yesterday.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich and she had the eggs florentine.  My breakfast sandwich was really quite good.  It was like a little omelet sandwich inside a croissant.  It was priced right and I would definitely order it again.  Her eggs florentine was just ok.  She would have preferred if the spinach was cut up a little bit smaller so that all of the leaves didn't come out in one bite.  The patio was a nice atmosphere, and the decor was nice, and that's why I gave it the one star that I did.  The reason I didn't give it any more stars is because the service was epically, comically bad.  Like we both wondered if we were being punk'd or something, like it was a joke.  \n\nOur server disappeared for several minutes at a time repeatedly.  First she took our drink order and brought us our drinks and said she would be back to take our food order.  Literally 15 minutes later she finally ventured back out to the patio and took our order.  We were already a bit frustrated at that point because as soon as my girlfriend saw my coffee, she decided she wanted one, but had to wait forever just to order it.  \n\nOur food was brought out by a different server, and right away we knew we needed some hot sauce and ketchup for our hash browns and eggs.  No one came back a few minutes later to see if we had everything we needed, which is basic serving 101.  Another 10 - 15 minutes went by and finally I just got up and went inside to track someone down.  Once we were done eating they took our plates and dropped off our check.  We put our card out to pay for the meal, but after another 20 minutes of it sitting on the corner of our table we eventually just got up and took it inside to pay.  And all the while both servers that served us were not friendly or welcoming at all.  It was like we were annoying them.  We were there for like 90 minutes, and probably more than half of that we spent just waiting for our server to come around so that we could move forward with the dining process.\n\nI might be able to understand some of this behavior if they were slammed.  But they weren't even 1/4 full when we got there.  And part of me wants to give them the benefit of the doubt because they have only been open a week, but after thinking about it, no.  There is no excuse for this type of crappy service, and really it has nothing to do with how long a restaurant has been open.  \n\nI don't know if we'll be back to give this place another try or not.  With all the great dining options in downtown, a place can't really afford to make too many bad first impressions.	0
	1453	"What a great place!!  The wait can be a little crazy, but the food is delicious, the service is always great and the atmosphere is adorable!  \n\nIt's a really neat setup - huge outdoor patio with seating and bar, plus waiting area.  Then a building with a smaller, cozier indoor seating section.  There are tons of neat, old-timey decorations, including old movie/ ad posters.  The colors are mostly red and green, and it all comes together nicely in every Oregano's, including this one.\n\nWe ordered an 18\"" thin crust Sproccolli, which lasted for two meals for us.  The crust is super thin and the ingredients are spread over it lighty.  The flavors are wonderful - just a little sauce, cheese, topping, garlic, etc. - making each bite light and tasty, but still filling.  It's pretty delicious cold, too.  Can't wait to try the thicker pizza, too!\n\nThe service has always been really outstanding, in my experience.  I joke that, at Oregano's, they always treat you like they just found out you're Yelp Elite (even though I've been coming here since before I learned about Yelp)."	3
	1454	Pretty close to my house, so I tried it out when I first moved to the area.  Very unimpressed.  Nice ambiance, but the sushi was overpriced and nothing special.  I believe they used to have a late night happy hour deal, which would have been cool, but that's gone.  I'll be taking my sushi business elsewhere.	1
	1455	Relatively quiet. Comfortable seats. Plentiful power. Easy wi-fi. Restrooms. Ideal.\n\nOther than the usual Starbucks coffee, a perfect spot to stop and top off your caffeine level, upload pictures and get a brief rest.\n\nThis Starbucks is right across from Canongate Kirk and the Museum of Edinburgh.	2
	1456	I wanted so badly to try their Famous Nutella Tiramisu- well it's just my luck that  it wasn't available on the day I went. They had regular and Mexican Tiramisu instead.... I wasn't really into those flavors as I already had my tastebuds ready for the Nutella one. However, I did get to sample the regular Tiramisu and that was OK- I'm not really a big fan of Tiramisu itself but I am a fan of Nutella... I was surprised to see that they also have a Strawberry Tiramisu  - I'd come back to try a slice of that one.\n\n*** Everything could be a bit cheaper if you ask me***\n\nI did notice that they had one Apricot Custard Croissant left- I claimed it and my daughter got the chocolate croissant. I have to say that the Apricot Croissant was hellah yummy....I loved that the Apricot was a bit tangy and the custard was so creamy but more like a pudding than a cream. The croissant itself was delish!!! The Apricot Croissant is a winner in my book....\n\nAfter eating the Apricot Croissant - the Chocolate croissant was Bleh to me, it didn't compare. I think it lacked Chocolate....\nI had a Mango/Green Tea Smothie with Whipped Cream and that drink was sugar overload. WAY TOO SWEET!!!! and I love sweets but damn...\nI do want to come back when it's cooler and try their hot chocolate, the cashier said that when the hot chocolate is at room temperature it becomesmore like a pudding, that's how chocolatety it is... Can't wait!!!\nThis was my first time in here so I had alot of questions and the guy behind the counter tried his best to answer them however the young lady who took over  made me feel like I was holding her up from doing other stuff. I didn't like that at all and they lose a star for service....	2
	1457	management changed and quality and service have deteriorated. decent ambiance.	1
	1458	"I am a Silver Preferred member on US Airways. This has gotten me the same lousy level of customer service representatives, the same lousy website (why do I need to call you to view my itinerary when the flight number changed?) as everyone. \n\nI have few complaints about the flights, except they're expensive to fly direct from SFO to Pittsburgh, even though they're \""a low cost carrier\"". The whole different check in line for flights from SFO to LAS/PHX and PIT/CLT /PHL is kinda weird too.\n\nI'm through with you guys. The only time I'll fly US Airways is when I _need_ a direct flight to Pittsburgh."	1
	1459	Hall of Frames stinks. \n\nThey recently started advertising with Yelp and have repeatedly complained to Yelp about a 100% genuine and honest 3 star review I wrote about my experience with their service. So Yelp has removed it twice. Now it's rewritten and a 1-star review:\n\n80% of the cuts on their frames are very sloppy. They try to cover it up with putty and hope you won't notice. \n\nFortunately, the guys at this Scottsdale store are really nice and they have a no-hassle re-make policy.\n\nUnfortunately, they've jacked up their prices. A lot. Now, even with a coupon, their current prices are at about the same level as their non-discounted prices from a few months ago. Now it's no longer worth all the hassle to get custom frames from HOF.\n\nSave your money and go someplace else where they will do the job right the first time.	0
	1460	You can't fake diarrhea. \n\nThese f*rs gave me VEAL parmigiana when I'd ordered CHICKEN. Until then, I'd never eaten veal and had no desire ever to do so. \n\nI was so upset and the best both the waiter and manager could do was apologize, say they'd take it off the bill (they better!!! I had two bites!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), then launch an explanation as to how, on a busy night, the kitchen could make a mistake. \n\nI don't care WHY it happened. That's the restaurant's business. I care THAT IT HAPPENED. Unconscionable.  \n\nTo top it off, I had total food poisoning that night and the following morning. Yes, I was completely nauseated that I'd consumed veal, but this wasn't psychosomatic. \n\nLike I said, you can't fake diarrhea.	0
	1461	My daughter and I shared the babaganouch, cheese egg rolls, beef lula and chicken lula. We really enjoyed the appetizers but were both disappointed with the beef and chicken. The texture was mushy & fatty. Overall, cute & clean but I would not recommend the proteins.	2
	1462	I know this place typically has a long wait but somehow I snuck in on a Saturday afternoon and sat at the bar for breakfast right away.  The service was amazingly fast.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it literally came out in less than 30 seconds.  I was sitting next to the grill so I saw that they really made it and didn't just reheat something and their speed is impressive!  The food was pretty tasty but it had a bit too much chorizo (and I love meat).  Huge portion sizes and definitely a very Pittsburgh sort of place.  Don't go here if you are looking for something healthy ;)\n\nI went back again later with a couple of friends and we all had a great experience.  The portions are HUGE and everything was delicious.  I think my friend's omelet had like 6 eggs and at least a pound of meat.	3
	1463	had a package deal, dinner at the Sugar Factory and the play Jersey Boys. My son and I were celebrating his birthday. The play was fantastic, however I was disappointed with the restaurant before I was even seated. The hostess was a young women with a tattoo on her back with long straight black hair. She was so inhospitable. No smile ever. We were told the wait was 20-30 minutes and if we wanted to wait. I told her I had no choice because I had a dinner voucher. The Salmon was dry and asparagus over cooked. My son enjoyed his $36 dollar drink. My drink was too sweet though. My waitress was fine. Seemed over worked. I won't come back or recommend this restaurant. I usually read reviews. Wish I had read up on this place	1
	1464	(fyi, originally wrote this review in September 2012, and forgot it was in my drafts! So, as some time has gone by, your mileage may vary. I'm not trying it again just to compare though haha)\n\nI had done some quick research to find some decent ramen places in Montreal, cause I loved having it when I was in Japan and craved it. This place got mentioned a couple of times, and I'm nearby daily so I decided to check it out. Honestly, I was expecting to be disappointed but... This is not ramen at all. The broth is extremely thin and tasteless, the vegetables were precut and the meat precut and precooked, so dry. I found the noodles a bit soggy and the seasoning was just... Pho-like, honestly. I'm disappointed, I really wanted to get my ramen fix, but this is not the place. :( if you've had ramen in Japan, I doubt you will like it here. If you haven't, honestly I'd rather have a good pho or Thai express, pretty similar or better...	0
	1465	I love this ride only because it was on CSI: Las Vegas....\n\nIts a place where Grissom rides when he has a rough night on the job!\n\nYes I watch CSI and YES I am a dork...and YES I've purchased CSI shirts from this place, which I will never do again because the off the strip cheap T-Shirt joints sold it for way cheaper!!! DAMMIT!	4
	1466	"We went here on Wed for my grandson's birthday.  We got there about 8 pm and it was sort of busy, and mariaches were singing. The waitress didn't speak English and we had questions about some menu items which were in Spanish. It took us awhile to order due to the language barrier [two dishes were described exactly the same in different sections w/different prices, and other issues] and her serving other tables. By that time, the place had totally cleared out, including the music. My son and his wife got their shrimp burro meals fairly fast, then quite awhile later when they were finished, my grandson got his bacon-wrapped shrimp [he wasn't hungry any more from eating chips, etc], and then 15-20 minutes later, I got my \""seafood stuffed fish\"" [ I guess seafood means only \""shrimp\"" and veggies on top]. It took over an hour for my fiancee to get his Zarande Ado Relleno [grilled whole fish w/veggies on top] and I had to request his side of tortillas that were to come with it. He had been sharing my food and eating lots of chips, salsa and ceviche because he was starving, so wasn't hungry any more. He took a couple of bites of his meal and packed it to go [as did my Grandson]--we had to leave because he gets up very early for work, and it was after 9:30. On a positive note, the salsa was one of the best I've ever had [would like to get the recipe], and that along with the chips and ceviche [nice perk], and Margaritas(!) saved us while waiting for our food. However, although servings were generous the seafood did not have much flavor, was overcooked and a disappointment after reading some of the glowing reviews. It was not the waitress's fault the food took so long and she comped us on a round of drinks while we waited for the last two plates. Otherwise, she was fairly attentive, but it was very frustrating trying to communicate with her, only speaking muy poquito Espanol and using hand gestures. She did apologize, and I was sorry it was a negative experience because we were there to \""celebrate\"" a birthday."	1
	1467	Having been to Naples, I must say that the food at Cibo's is very delicious.  The trouble with Americans is that they are used to all the sauce, all the topings and it isn't that way in Italy.  The point of pizza is to be able to taste each individual ingrediate and you do at Cibo's.  The brick oven preparation of the crust and all of the breads used for sandwiches is by far the best I have tasted.  I highly recommend Cibo's for the food, the ambiance and the service.	4
	1468	I just recently moved back to Charlotte and haven't tried any nail places yet but I visit Stonecrest often and always saw Polished. It looked like a nice, modern place so I gave it a shot. \n\nI went around 5:00 pm Monday evening for a full-set. It was dead, dead, deadsky. \n\nMy first impression of Polished at Stonecrest was not a good one. I walked in, smiled, said hello and only received stares from each and every employee. I honestly thought I had just interrupted a staff meeting and was about to turn around and walk out. After about ten seconds, a young lady finally asked what I wanted and a gentleman led me to a counter at the back. He asked me to sit at a seat that was directly across from two gentleman employees, both of whom were playing on their phones, and neither of which acknowledged my existence. I take that back... they both looked at me when I sat down, then looked at the gentleman that led me back there, said something and then I was asked to sit in another seat in front of a young lady. \n\nShe was nice enough, offered a drink (I got white wine, it was decent), didn't talk much, (I'm fine with that), and gave me a mediocre set of acrylic nails. There are lots of air bubbles, some of which are large enough to look like chips in the acrylic. \n\nI won't be going back and will not suggest it to my friends. I think I'll stick with smaller, quaint nail salons. They've always provided the best customer service, in my opinion.	1
	1469	Too much damn frosting!  And I never thought I would say that.  To me a perfect cupcake has the right amount of frosting for every bite of cake.  For this to be the case with Gigi's you would need to double the size of the cake.  This is not the type of cupcake you could just eat without the use of a fork/spoon in my opinion or you'd wind up with a face full of frosting. \n\nI tried three flavors.  Scarlett's Red Velvet:  I didn't really taste the Red Velvet flavor of the cake and it was moist to the point of being soggy because of the additional filling.\nThe White Midnight Magic, a devil's food cake, and the Birthday Surprise, white cake,  I found them both to be a bit on the dry side.  I realize this is a franchise and they are most likely allowed to set their prices at each location but if that's the case the website should not state a price of $3.00 on their cupcake price listing menu page when this location is $3.50.  \n\nEven though I was not a fan of these cupcakes and that's just my personal taste the store is nicely decorated with some cute merchandise available for purchase and the counter girls were extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the flavors available that day.	1
	1470	"The Tron is one of those bars that always seems like a good idea, but then when you go you realise its actually disappointing and you should have gone elsewhere. \n\nDown a steep flight of stairs is a rather dull pub with not much going on. The drinks aren't great quality, I hear the pints are like \""piss water\"". We once had food here and it was nothing more than mediocre. \n\nWhat I hate about the Tron is the toilets. Call me old fashioned, but I like to do my business in a clean environment. Maybe that is my OCD coming out? I don't know. One night I went here and out of the three toilet cubicles one was missing a door, one didn't have a lock and the other was well... you don't really want me to go into detail. I was once told the standard of toilets tells you a lot about the quality of a place. That visit put me right off for good! \n\nThe Tron is very popular with students though, so it does okay and is quite busy on a Friday/Saturday night."	1
	1471	"Save your money\nThe highlight(s) is when Teller performs his illusions alone. Penn is given to dissertations, lectures, explanations, and generally boring banter about what is to happen next. The \""trick\"" is sort of anticlimactical to his banter, which by the way is difficult to understand because he speaks so quickly."	1
	1472	The name says it all .. This place is really my second kitchen when I'm back in Vegas .. I recommend the carnitas or a carne asada burrito ... Both made very well and always filling ... Try rhe nachos but bring a friend cause it's a huge dish	3
	1473	hungry at 4am and trying to find inebriated friends wandering the casino floor, we stumbled upon cafe bellagio.... \n\n[x] open at an ungodly hour\n[x] requires shoes (don't ask)\n[x] service sucked\n[x] hot overpriced mediocre food\n[x] crashing back at the hotel at 6am full	1
	1474	Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n8 Food\n8 Service\n7 Atmosphere\n9 Value\n\nI sampled the Cookies & Creme (very good), and then had a little Tart, Mango, and York Peppermint.  The tart was good, the Mango (w/ coconut & strawberries) and York (w/ coconut & marshmallows) both excellent - and the topping selection abundant.\n\nThe service was also good, except I did see a little kid playing back behind the counter when I walked in?  Stay away from my marshmallows!\n\nI really liked how small the place was (how much space do you really need to get froyo?) and the detail in the decor, but the seating was uncomfortable for the sake of aesthetics and the back toppings were hard to get to because of the sneeze guard.  But I do love pay-by-the-pound   :)  I gave it 3 stars, but it's a strong 3 and more visits could easily make it a 4 if things fall into place.\n\nWhat I think we need, is a Fro Yo Face Off between MoJo, Zwirl, and Yogurtland.	2
	1475	Absolutely the nicest, most beautiful and unique convention area in Las Vegas. The bathrooms are always kept clean, with complimentary individual size mouthwash and lotion by every sink, restocked regularly. The hallway is breathtaking, one wall is entirely glass, overlooking the pool complex, and letting in actual sunlight, so one can still get one's daily dose of Vitamin D even in a full day of meetings! There are modern, sleek looking couches and loveseats that are very comfortable to relax in. The meeting rooms and ballrooms are designed beautifully, with wood paneling and acoustically absorbing wall panels (important to me as a sound engineer working in them!). Even the outdoor smoking area is well kept, with real trees for shade. It's definitely my favorite place to work in town.	4
	1476	On a road trip from San Diego to Denver and yelped this little gem!  SO delicious!!! It's hard to stay feeling healthy while on a road trip and rest assured thanks to YELP and Grass Roots we are able to do so!\n\nI believe her name was Kim, cousin to the owner.  She was SO kind and knowledgable.  She asked us what we liked and offered some suggestions on the menu, as well as told us we can customize our juice.  She made it very easy and never rushed us, which made it all that more comfortable.  \nand the juice is SO delicious!	4
	1477	"I've been coming to this place religiously for the last couple of years. I always get the ~$20 silver wash. I came in today and the service advisor informed me that in order to get my interior cleaned completely, (due to trace amounts of dog hair, my dog has never even been in my vehicle) I would need to purchase the $40 \""pet lovers\"" wash.  He stated that if I did not purchase the \""pet lovers\"" wash, he could not say whether or not their guys would vacuum my truck. I mentioned their currently displayed signage proclaiming an additional $4 for dog hair removal and said I would pay that fee if necessary.  I was told that even though the sign was still being displayed, they did not offer that anymore and I would need to buy the \""pet lovers\"" wash, that is double the price of my usual selection and has features I don't need, in lieu of my usual wash. The only difference would be spending an extra 2 minutes on the vacuum.  The guy even began to raise his voice and become argumentative.   I did not purchase the \""pet lovers\"" wash and proceeded with my usual Silver package. I tipped the crew my usual $10 and left Alamo Car Wash for the last time.  It's a real shame that they have gone down this road. They do good work, but I'm not going to come back if I have to pay double because I have 5 dog hairs on my carpet."	0
	1478	Just got back from Vega and I went to Wicked Spoon on a Sunday night, the food quality was fantastic but the variety was limiting. Overall I would still give it 4 stars just on the quality of the food as well as the quality of the service. I think we pad $41 per person but I got a buy one get one free coupon on my united airlines flight. I would recommend to anyone to go to this buffet if they get a chance.	3
	1479	Searched yelp for carpet cleaners, and saw the excellent reviews on yelp about this company. Thank you fellow Yelpers!! I called and made an appointment for a 1pm appointment, no window time like other companies. They showed up on time and were courteous and proffessional. They introduced themselves as Ryan and Gene and asked us if we had any problem areas. The price they quoted was also the price they charged. They did an excellent job cleaning our carpet and made it look fantastic!! We had a couple of questions at the end about how much it would be to clean our sofa, it was a very reasonable price, and we also received recommendations about a.c. service and duct cleaning. Thank you Ryan and Gene for being a honest and professional company. We will recommend you to family and friends!!!	4
	1480	If you're healthy food conscious and like a less institutionalized ambiance this is not the place for you. My son and I ordered and split the vegie burger and the salmon. The best part of dinner was the glass of red wine, and the salmon was ok. \nOk for American hamburgers and steaks I guess. We didn't try them. Our waitress was really attentive and sweet, and helped to salvage our dining experience. Oh, and the food was ready rather quickly. I'd recommend that there be a few fresh spring greens and arugala on the menu for us grass eaters.	0
	1481	"I rarely have a doughnut. I think most doughnuts, like breakfast places, are exactly the same. That or they're notably terrible. It's a black and white world. However, I heard about this place and saw a picture of the Fat Elvis and had to give it a shot.\n\nI pretty much ordered one of everything. I will say, with confidence, everything is fresh and delicious. Given, I still think doughnuts are mostly hype, but these had measurable freshness. There is a good mix of \""bready\"" texture and \""pastry\"" in the mix. It's just right. The Fat Elvis definitely stole the show for me. Even a simple cake covered in chocolate with peanuts sprinkled on top was a little more impressive than the competition. Oddly, though, my typical favorite doughnut - the apple fritter - was a bit underwhelming compared to some others I've had.\n\nSo, why not 5 stars? Because it's just a doughnut shop in terms of appearance and ambiance and there is definitely more to be had. Unless I just don't understand that people never stick around with doughnuts anyway."	3
	1482	The location is good, but the food is far from authentic Japanese food. The teriyaki sauce seems fake. Better choices for Japanese food in town would be Yellowfin or Kamakura. I thought the prices were too high for what you got. College kids might enjoy the large portions of food however.	1
	1483	Since I live in Tempe, I attempt to find good places to grab quick noshes that are NOT chain or fast food joints. One of my favs is Ted's or a dog, white hot, or polish. \n\nAll of them great fresh charbroiled and smothered in Teds famous chili sauce, onions and mustard. The onion rings and corn dogs are winners too.\n\nOne recommendation to a first timer. Take cash and do not go at lunch. Really packed with long lines at lunch. My only other knock is the weak soft drink selection.\n\nTed's is so good that Z's Chicago dog opened across the street and lasted all of three months as nobody went. If  Z's opened in any hood in town they would've rocked but not against Ted's of Buffalo.	3
	1484	After my earlier adventures in the night. Finally came here for the graveyard specials, which start at 11 pm.  Just ate an hour and half earlier but still thought I could use some food, at least some soda to quench my thirst or something to go for later on. $4.99 for ny steak, pork chop, chicken fried steak, half roast chicken, or spaghetti and meatballs. there's also $2.99 deuces wild which is two pancakes, 2 bacon, and 2 eggs. they even offer loco moco and some pretty good $9.99 meal like full rack of baby back ribs, bbq combination plate, t-bone and eggs. I just filled up on soda and ate some of my food, everyone else ate up.	3
	1485	To celebrate a birthday, 4 sisters, 1 daughter and 1cousin spent 3 days at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay this past weekend.  Very disappointing, it's our second time at the hotel, and it will be our last.  We booked 2 rooms together with queen beds, and we were given king  rooms at opposite ends of the 18th floor.    \nWe were told we should have called the week prior to check-in to request the rooms be near each other.  When we said that we called 2 weeks prior, 1 week prior and 2 days prior to request the rooms together,  we were just told that's 'the best they can do'.  Then he said the Hotel didn't even have rooms with queen beds.....(NOT TRUE) \n\nA few unfortunate negatives were:\n- When we checked in we had to lug our own bags upstairs and there was a MOLDY,   I MEAN FUZZY GREEN MOLDY room service tray in front of one of our rooms that stayed there for 24 hours. There were bags of empty boxes and garbage and green fuzzy cheese and strawberries.\n- There were not bathrobes, no slippers and no towels in our room.\n-  Most  of the staff that we had contact with, were not very friendly and seemed    unhappy to be working at the resort. \n- The woman at the cafe would not give me small bills for change when I paid for our breakfast.  I asked for 2 tens and 2 fives and she said no, she couldn't do that....(even though I could see she had a lot of five's and ten's in the register...)\n-  The wave pool, and lazy river are tiny and took about 10 minutes to walk to through the casino area....\n- These were supposed to be Suites, but there were no refrigerators and the Kurig coffee pot was there, although they told us it was $4.00 for each cup of coffee.\n- We asked for late check out for one of the rooms since our flights didn't leave until 5:30 and they said they could not accommodate us. \nOn Sunday morning we asked for our bill so we could come back to pay.  He asked how our stay was, and we said we would have liked our rooms to be closer together, and he asked what time we checked in.  When we told him we arrived on Thursday evening he laughed...  He actually LAUGHED and said ' Well, that's why we couldn't get you rooms together... you have to check in early in the morning'.  (Isn't check in 3:00?)\n\nDon't bother staying at this hotel.  There are tons of other options...	0
	1486	This place is phenomenal. Went here on a whim after a hike and stumbled upon this gem. This might be the best Thai food I've ever had. \n\nOrdered the Massamon Curry and the Beef Pad See Ew. Also tried the Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and the House Fried Rice. Everything was DELICIOUS. Seriously. The curry was super flavorful, the noodles were chewy and yummy, and everything had the perfect amount of heat. I'd recommend the Massamon Curry and the Pad See Ew forsure. The portions are huge too!\n\nDefinitely a little hole-in-the-wall place that serves amazing Thai food. Don't miss out on this place.	4
	1487	Upside: big, lots of stores, & great selection! Downside:  most of the toilets are broke, vending machines take money, & the little kiddie ride they have are either broke or takes your money!	2
	1488	a lot of money for nothing , I stilla to have my problem and I still to pain.	0
	1489	First off, I do love Buffalo Wild Wings.  The original wings with buffalo seasoning are delicious! The food here was okay, my wings were broken and having shards of bone stick out of your food is not appetizing to say the least. \nThe cheesecake bites were great!\n\nThe review is mostly for the service, which was for lack of a better word TERRIBLE.  The waitress sauntered over while chewing gum, as if she was doing us a favor, and took our orders but did not write anything down.  She had to ask a few times for us to repeat it, while still getting the drink wrong.  Mind you there are only two of us, so it should not have been such a feat.  Our orders came out wrong, wrong side dish but we did not mention anything at that point as to not have to deal with it anymore. Overall, she seemed more focused on serving groups of guys seated all around then any other customer.	0
	1490	Ok, if I could have given this business negative stars, I probably would have! So I guess my 1 star is just for the merchandise in the store, lol.\nI visited this store in November 2014 looking for a dumbbell rack with diff sized dumbbells. There were 2 clerks and I was the only customer in the store. They both appeared preoccupied with whatever they were doing at the counter(texting, reading, loafing...you fill in the blank)! \nPoor customer service, no greeting, reluctant and lack luster assistance when I ask for help with some equipment, condescending language. I felt like I was a bother to them so I walked right out of that store without a word. Shame on them for treating a paying customer with such disrespect! I'd rather buy it new.	0
	1491	My situation is frustrating. And it gives me a headache, just thinking about it. I bought a new Toyota Scion TC 2014. It was my first ever car and I've never had car insurance before. This particular State Farm office was the only one with the lowest, lowest, lowest price. Very fishy!!! When all the quotes I've gotten was $300-$900 a month. \n\nI'll just say... Make sure you go over everything with the sales rep. See how much it cost and know exactly what kind of discount they are putting on your insurance policy. I paid the lowest price. And four months later... Out of no were, ended up paying double the price without no explanation until you go in person yourself. Supposedly, they can't change the mistake and refund you. When it was their error! Giving out the wrong information to customers is not good at all.	0
	1492	I'm not usually big on chains but this was really great pizza.  We had the thin crust Numero One-O and it was great.  The sausage and peperoni were really good and so were the veggies and more importantly it was the correct amount of topping.\n\nWe also had a cesar salad, it was huge!  The server warned us that a junior salad was more than enough to split and she was right.\n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful.  Definitely will go back.	3
	1493	This person stole our images and posted them on her website as her own.  Do not be fooled, she is a fraud and not a real photographer.	0
	1494	We ate lunch here on a 2 week business trip because we were running out of options for a quick lunch that wasn't fast food. This was the worst lunch we had during the trip.  Terrible service and terrible food.  I got the shrimp entree with mixed vegetables of broccoli, mushroom, onion, zucchini and sweet carrot. Absolutely terrible.  I have never had overcooked stir fry before, it was mushy and disgusting.   Shumai dumplings were the worst I've ever had.  My friend had a similiar meal, I think with chicken.  The 3rd party had sushi that she didn't really eat so I'm not sure what the verdict was on that.  On top of the terrible food, it was over priced so we paid $23 each for food that sucked and regretted wasting our per diem there.	0
	1495	For those Vegas locals who rarely if ever venture out of the Las Vegas Valley, chances are you think Terrible's is great. But if you've ever been to Phoenix, Dallas, Kansas City, or Atlanta and been inside a QuikTrip location...well you know that any Terrible's location lives up to it's name. And this location...certainly carries the corporate name well. Getting in to the pumps and especially back out onto Pecos can be tight. Inside every time I've walked in the doors I found the place to be dirty. And cluttered. Can they find more stuff to line the counters with? Top it off with service that ranges from oh it's you again to OMG, I really wish I could be working anywhere else and you get a classic Terrible experience. \n\nOh and the bathrooms? Maybe if you're having a kaopectate moment and desperation forces the issue. Bring lots and lots of hand sanitizer. Don't say you haven't been warned. \n\nYour best bet here: Pay at the pump, then scram. \n\n(Yelp 100 in 2013 Challenge #13)	1
	1496	This is the most beautiful and fun nightclub I have every been to! I didn't know a nightclub could be soooo gorgeously decorated. You feel like you've stepped into an attraction at Disneyland rather then a stuffy, crowded, dark, and dank nightclub. As you can see I have low expectations for nightclubs in general. But this one was different and I had an awesome time dancing and drinking. The place did get a bit crowded but not as bad as my experience at Pure. VIP tables were expensive but very well laid out and the waitstaff was very attentive. All in all this was one of the best nightclub experiences I have ever had.	4
	1497	Great venue. Many cigar sites rate this as a top cigar bar, but they don't allow cigar smoking. :\\	2
	1498	"Ok...so your thinking that this is just another average review.  I say \""NO!\""  this is a challenge to a very needed restaurant in Gilbert.  Sushi that drives by your table on a continuos basis is very under-rated.  Please don't judge until you have experienced it.  Ahi Revolving Sushi has occupied the space of a previously failed Japanese restaurant and done their best to present a business model that could succeed.  However, there are some glaring observations that I feel will only lead to failure.  They are as follows:\n1. Secure a Liquore license prior to opening.  Even LDS business owners know this rule\n2. Don't scare your patrons away with life sucking fluorescent lights in your dining room.\n3. Sushi restaurants need to serve things like \"" Sake Bombers\""  see number 1\n4. Don't hang unlit fluorescent lights like you are threatening patrons that you could suck more life out of you if you wanted to.  see number 2.\n\nThe truth:  good Sushi, good prices, good service....Scary environment, my eyes hurt, oh God"	2
	1499	They leave coupons on my door all the time. I called to order one day and they said the delivery costs extra because I live far away. I'm only 6 streets down!	0
	1500	Worst experience I have ever had getting a facial! First off she put a cream on my face that started to burn, I advised her it was burning and she took her time taking it off. Then she was on her phone (texting) majority of the time. My appt. Was for an hour she was done less than 45 minutes and most of that time she was on her phone. She put a lotion on my face and told me I was done. I felt like I was getting punked! That's how bad it was! I would never ever recommend this place for a facial!	0
	1501	There was a long line at 10 pm. Definitely worth the wait. I ordered the smoke meat. The first bite was so heavenly. Smoked chicken and coleslaw were quite unique. It was fun to talk to the servers and locals about Montreal and the food. Overall, This is quite good!	4
	1502	I know this place just opened so usually I can excuse the fact that the employees bad service is chalked up to inexperience and getting use to the place. However it doesn't excuse the disgusting long hair I found in my food. Go somewhere else.	0
	1503	Dont go here\nWe decieded to go here for breakfast today and we left at about 11:30. When we got there They told us it would be 15 mins to get a tabel, we got one 30 mins later. We sat down at an area so loud You couldnt hear yourself think, And by the time we got our food it was like 1:30 ONE thirty!!!!\nThe food turned out to suck so i didnt eat and we ended up going to poppies bagels, a much better meal.	0
	1504	My wife and I love this place. Our go to for dinner and a movie, everything I've ever had here is delicious. Maybe it's partly the nostalgia for me as I grew up with Mi Amigo's in the east valley. Consistently great food at a decent price, can't complain about that.	3
	1505	I have visited Peter's Yard a couple of times now with a friend and have enjoyed my experience. They serve nice strong loose tea, which is always a plus in my book. And my friends love the coffee. The pastries, cakes and sandwiches look amazing, and I'm looking forward to trying that soon... due to having been here at odd hours between meals, it just hasn't happened yet... but I do end up staring at the food on the counter, if I have to admit it. \n\nIf you visit on a cold day, then it's worth ordering a very warm drink. There is a bit of a draft through the whole place. This is due to a faulty door, which they have made a sign for. It really might be worth fixing that. \n\nI want to give the Yard at least 4 stars, but I'm just not there yet. This is a pity as it has the food and look and feel of a place that should be getting 5 stars. This is partly to do with the fact that both times I've visited I haven't had much interaction with the staff. It actually seems a bit like responsibilities in the kitchen seem to have priority over managing the till and the customers. I still think the place could easily earn a higher rating from most recent reviewers, but maybe they have become too confident in the quality of their food to the detriment of the little things.	2
	1506	"Stayed here several days for a conference. Though they do have tennis courts, spa, pools, and a golf course; it's much more isolated than what you would expect. It's also quite spread out and hilly, and you may end up having to take the hotel shuttle to different parts of the resort (even to your room). \n\n The lobby area is fairly small, there isn't much place to just \""hang out\""---other than the pool. Unfortunately for us, it happened to be cold the days we were there, so there wasn't much of an opportunity to do that. Beyond that, probably the biggest negative aspect of this resort is that it is really far away from anything fun that you would want to do.Taking a cab to downtown Phoenix or Scottsdale is about $50-$60 each way. \n\nWe tried both of the restaurants, and they were both good for dinner. Only one of them offered breakfast or lunch. There is also a cafe that offers Starbucks beverages in the lobby."	2
	1507	Ordered take out California Roll, Chicken satay, and a Udon Noodle Bowl. The California roll had a hair on the wasabi, which I don't use anyway but still gross. The chicken satay, the Chicken was very juicy but the peanut sauce, Not listed as SPICY was WAY SPICY. Not Cool. The Chicken Udon bowl was, well blah, boring as hell. Still in the fridge , who knows if it will get eaten or thrown away. Too many other great place, won't be back.	1
	1508	So we yelp this place and saw that it had great reviews. We were craving carne asada tacos so we trusted the comments. As soon as we got in the facility, it was like a smoke house. You could hardly breathe. So we waited in line for about 10 minutes to find out that we were in the wrong line. Still trying to be positive, we got in a line that you could only order carne.  \n\nWe orders 6 carne asada tacos and carne fries. Not only did we pay about 26 bucks, the food tasted terrible. The meat was so hard and the tortillas were soaked with grease, we just left the food on the table for everybody to see. I was really surprised due to the reviews. Maybe it was just a bad day for us, but I don't think we will give it another chance.	0
	1509	This place sells sick pets. We bought a guinea pig from there and the very next day were noticing that it was displaying signs of being sick. We shouldn't have been surprised because they kept at least 9 guinea pigs in one cage.	0
	1510	I've been to this Jason's a few times, and it's been good every time, but tonight I had their Nutty Mixed up Salad and they went from good to amazing. The chicken was fresh grilled and the balsamic vinaigrette dressing is superb. Highly recommended.	4
	1511	What's sad about this review is that my husband and I never even tried the food! We went on a busy Saturday night and were fine with the 45 minute wait. However, after an hour my husband asked the hostess how much longer for the wait and we were told our seats were given to one of their regular customers! How do they expect to gain new regular customers this way?  We had money to spend!!  We were offered a round of free drinks, and after waiting so long, we decided to give it another try. We were suckers like that. When we finally got our table, we noticed a bunch of other empty tables all around us. We received our menus, and the waiter never came back! We waited an additional 10 minutes and I had to leave before I threw a tantrum. I have to say, in all my years of eating out, this was definitely the worst experience I've ever had, I'll never be back and I have informed all I know how horrible this place treats potential customers.	0
	1512	Service is absolutely terrible at this place! If you get a server named Mandi, request a different one immediately.\n\nTo begin with, I was sat in a booth that did not allow high chairs, apperantly it is a fire hasard to have a high chair slightly blocking a passage way... so then why was a sat here??? We were moved to a different booth, In which the crapiest server I've had in a long time was stationed, Mandi. \n\nWe sat for about 10 minutes before mandy greeted us, by the time she finally came by I was ready to order. I asked for an Avacado burger and my gf had the brown sugar banana pancakes. To drink, we both had water. \n\nMandi brought out our waters NO STRAW. Don't you just hate that lol. I would have loved to asked Mandi for straws but she was no where to be found. So I sipped straw-less. \n\n25 long minutes later, she finally shows up and lets us know she will find out what is taking so long with our order. She comes back to the table food and all. Makes me wonder if the food was ready before hand and she just then got around to checking. \n\nThe food was amazing, it was worth the wait, my Avacado burger was yummy and HUGE. My gf's banana panckaes were so good too! The food is why this place even has 3 stars from me. \n\nHalfway through my meal, my water runs out... but where is Mandi? My lovely gf offers to share her's. \n\nWe finish eating, time to pay the bill. We wait and wait but no Mandi? wtf... I have a 2 year old with me, they get impatient fast and I have to sit and wait for another half hour, till finally my gf goes and looks for her. She finds her visibly eating in the lounge area... oh we were pissed. We left the money, an angry note to the manager.	2
	1513	It's ok. They have flavors I don't really like. But the service is good and it's a walking distance from the place I live))	2
	1514	"Ambiance, decor, delectable regional cuisine from Mexico, all combine to make this a truly wonderful destination for all things Mexican.  The original chef, a former taco stand owner on the island of Cozumel, made his way here in the 90's and opened \""Such is Life\"", a phrase he adapted from a friend who invested in his dreams back in the island days.  Once upon a time, this restaurant had garnered so much attention, it was even listed as one of Phoenix's most interesting dining destinations by the New York Times.  Although it has changed owners, they have tried to keep the original menu and the concept going strong.  From the hand painted portraits of Freda Kalo on the walls, to the colorful folk art and paintings, to the regional music playing softly over the speakers, this place smacks of authenticity inside and out.  When I am here, I feel like I am on holiday in the heart of Mexico.  And when my plate of Camaron Al Mojo de Ajo comes out, I am transported to the beach in Tulum or Puerto Vallarta.\n\nFirst \""must try\"" is the Crema De Cilantro.  Absolutely incredible soup with cilantro, garlic, potato puree, avocado, and chicken. As the name implies, it is divinely creamy and full of gorgeous, simple flavors.\n\nNext on the list should be the Queso Fundido with poblano, championes, chorizo, and nopales.  Excellent!  A slightly different take on what you would expect from a standard queso, and it does not disappoint with all of the wonderful ingredients.\n\nFor a light and coastal entree, I recommend the Camaron Al Mojo De Ajo.  For $24.95 you get a very generous plate of large, plump, butterflied shrimp baked with garlic and virgin olive oil.\n\nThis is absolutely one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, as it also offers diners a more fine dining culinary exploration.  The menu is simple.  Other entree offerings include fish filet and leg of lamb, and filet mignon.\n\nAppetizers range from $5.95-$12.95 from Ceviche Acapulco (marinated shrimp in fresh lime juice) to Coctel de Camaron (Pacific jumbo shrimp cocktail).\n\nAbsolutely everything ordered, down to the made to order guacamole and salsa verde (one of three salsas served at the table), the house margaritas, and Aqua frescas was outstanding and I would highly recommend a visit to this iconic Mexican restaurant."	4
	1515	Love this authentic little place. Didn't care for talarpia tacos but the rest of it is amazing.	3
	1516	Been here a few times when I'm in Vegas. They have an average food selection. But this place does give off a cute French vibe that makes you feel like you're in Paris. I wish they had more meats to choose from though because I'm a huge meat person. The only meat that was good was the prime rib. The rest were average.	2
	1517	The food here is rather decent Northern Chinese style. Their beef/pork pancake, fried leek dumplings are quite authentic as I originally was from that part of the region in China. Service are exceptional from the manager if you happen to speak mandarin. Decent portion and reasonable price. We almost visit them once a week even I live in Glendale which is around 1 hour's drive to Tempe.	3
	1518	Going to keep this short and sweet!\nTook my gf here for our 1 year anniversary dinner.  Was seated promptly, our server was great, he made sure everything was okay. Got the lobster salad, clean and crisp. My miso glazed halibut was SO good, fish was tender, there was this rice square thing I cant quite understand but with the fish it made the texture of everything go really well. When our creme brule dessert came out it said happy anniversary on it with a sparkler in it. I had made reservations on through the website and left a little note saying that it was going to be our anniversary, and it was great that the staff actually took the time to make us feel very welcomed. I enjoyed my experience here with my girlfriend. \n\nThanks Spago staff.	4
	1519	This has got to be one of the slowest drive-thrus I have ever had the pleasure of waiting in line for! I only ordered medium sized french fries and a hot chocolate, and it took at least 20 minutes to finally get my order!  And to top that off, when it was finally my turn at the window, it took them 5 minutes to open the window to tell me that my order will be ready shortly! You may think I am exaggerating, but I am not! Hopefully my next time there will not be as horrendous!	1
	1520	Come here if you know EXACTLY what you want. \n\nI don't usually do anything fancy to my hair, a trim, maybe layers and that's about it. For that reason, I don't care to spend more than $15 for a haircut and Great Clips is good for that. $13 for a cut + $3 if you want a shampoo.\n\nToday was my first time there and I got Marina as my stylist, if I can call them that. While I expected just a simple hair cut, she was noticed that my hair was dry during the shampoo (which it is because I don't use extra hair products other than shampoo) and offered some advice on how to restore moisture to my hair. \n\nIt was a Sunday morning and they were busy, mostly men and children and old ladies-- so if you're a chick who needs more done to your hair such as a consult, styling, hi-lights, etc then go somewhere else. Great Clips is good for simple, straight-to-point, cuts.	2
	1521	"I specifically went to this location, even though Desert Ridge is much closer to my home, after looking up the availability of a book I want that the other location didn't have. The website said it was in stock, so off I went. When I arrived I attempted to find the book myself. Fail. I went to the info desk where four women (employees) were chit-chatting, and it took them a solid 45 seconds to realize I was even there, then one had to point me out to the woman who was actually supposed to be manning the booth for help. Despite the fact that their computer listed the book in stock, she too could not find it on the shelf. \""It could be anywhere in the store,\"" she said. Then just looked at me. Because she wasn't going to help me actually find it so her store could actually make money and afford to pay her. I asked her to check and see if it was on hold for someone else so I didn't waste any further time looking for it; she agreed then disappeared in the exact opposite direction of where the books on hold are kept. Two other women came over and repeated the exact same scenario. It was very bizarre and unhelpful, and they all made me feel as if I was wasting their time - I'm so sorry, I'm just a potential paying customer. The real kick in the pants is that Amazon has it $5 cheaper including shipping, but I just wanted it today. I wasted that $5 in gas easily. Short story: Very unhelpful staff, not interested in making a sale. Will not return."	1
	1522	Must like mob & fbi history to appreciate the place.  If so, you are in for a special treat!  Reviewing actual wiretaps, evidence, video clips, and personal items from mob figures was a great experience.  All three floors had a different perspective and was real well curated.  They charge for parking, which is the reason that I didnt give it 5 stars.  But overall, a worthy visit.	3
	1523	yum, yum, yum, yum!!!!\n\nYUM #1: yaya angus slider: lettuce. tomato. red onion. feta cheese. tzatziki. red wine vinaigrette. YUM #2: caprese slider: grilled eggplant. roma tomato. basil. fresh mozzarella. balsalmic reduction. YUM #3: check in on yelp and get a free slider :O) YUM #4: the price!\n\nI can't wait to add more yums to this list...I just need an empty belly and a trip back to vegas!	4
	1524	For foodies:\n\nSo tempted to give lakeside 4 stars due to spectacle of light show and animatronics on display from outdoor seating. My friend saw Mr. Wynn dining in the restaurant the night before my meal. Lakeside is an experience but I am too starstruck by all the celebrity chefs starting restaurants (even if they never visit their Las Vegas creations) and therefor  I find it hard to recommend that you spend one of your few meals at lake side.\n\nFor non-foodies:\nIf you do not live and breathe food and you'd rather pay for spectacle than a chefs name then you may think lake side is a more exciting restaurant then the  other places that keep the surprise and delight confined to the menu.	2
	1525	Great location. Cool vibe. Attentive service. . .and, sadly, that's it. We had been looking forward to trying this place for quite some time since we have seen it front center at the EpiCentre.  We finally got the chance and were completely underwhelmed.  First we started with some margaritas--these should be an easy way to please anyone. They weren't.   The skinny margarita was just awful and I've had some good ones at other places in town (such as 1900 Mexican Grill which has a fantastic one). The regular margarita was just passable.  Perhaps the premium margaritas ones are better but I suspect we won't be back to try again.\n\nThe chips and salsa were really quite good.   After devouring 2 bowls of chips because they were so good we  figured the food would dazzle us.  We could not decide among all of the delicious offerings so tried 2 of the combo platters to try a good variety of the food.  They were chock full of good quality ingredients (crab, shrimp, fish, avocados) but somehow were rendered almost tasteless. Nothing stood out, except for the fact that the soft corn tortillas were greasy. The food at a casual burrito shop is easily more pleasing.  In college I worked in an average Mexican restaurant and the entrees here didn't even come close. \n\nThe banana tres leches cake for dessert was intensely flavored (nice change from the bland meal) but really good (if you don't fear banana flavor). It isn't a traditional tres leches so the waiter tried to steer us away from it.  I understand why, but it was very good and potent.\n\nAll in all this was a disappointment (chips, salsa and dessert excepted) and we love Mexican food. Not sure if we'd waste the calories on another try when there are so many other Mexican options in the Queen City.  That's too bad because the location is great and there aren't any other Mexican places uptown.	1
	1526	"Not even worth the \""Free with $5 service charge\"" price.  We were bored on a Saturday afternoon and had heard this was a good show, a show for the whole family, but I wish I could have back that hour of my life.\n\nNathan's tricks were lame.  A solid 3rd of the show consisted of special guests, so it wasn't even THE Nathan Burton, and one guy didn't even do magic -- just some lame show with some masks.  Nathan did the same trick 3 or 4 times in a row, which consisted of putting his assistant in some smoke and mirrors type box then having her disappear.  McKayla is not impressed.\n\nWhile we're talking about his assistants, they did way more work than he did.  I thought this was a family show, but those two poor women were just being objectified, sex being the butt of some of Burton's bad jokes to boot.  All they did was dance provacatively while Nathan Burton did lame tricks.  \n\nI would not do this again, not even if someone paid me money to do it."	0
	1527	This pasta place is very, very good and it has been around for a long time. It is in Marche De L'Ouest. The food is always very tasty. I normally have a meat ball and a  sausage with my pasta. You get to choose your sauce, just pick any one, they are all very tasty. You eat this in the food court area and that is why I give it four stars, but the food is 5 stars. Consistent good Italian food in the West Island.	3
	1528	I really use to love this place. I like to go dancing and ever since they took away the bar around the dance floor, there is no place to put your drink, lean and the dance floor is virtually nonexistent when it gets crowded. The last 3 times I've been there they served me beer in a 32oz cup not a mason jar wtf? Still this place is good to come see concerts Hopefully the one opening up in Peoria will be better.	1
	1529	Great everything. Except the way you pick up your food and fill your coffee at the same place. Who's idea was it to put the coffee pot in front of the window where you pick up your tray of food? There has to be a better way. \nThat is my only complaint. Otherwise, fritters are the bomb and anything you pick is pretty good.	3
	1530	"The view of the \""Lake\"" was a nice treat. it was my first time at  a Raw food establishment. The waitress was very helpful with my questions and gave me some helpful hints on what to order. The kale salad and tropical smoothie were very filling and refreshing."	2
	1531	I don't gamble but I live in Las Vegas (my mom moved us here 20 years ago). We come here mainly for the movie theater and the restaurants/food court- Baja Fresh (love this place- a discount is given to movie patrons), Panda Express, Fatburger, Starbucks, Dairy Queen, Sbarro (been to the buffet a long time ago, when this property first opened). I went to the club (tiny and crowded) a few times- also, a long time ago- in the beginning- Love Shack performed here (jeez, seems so long ago; don't know if they are still around). \n\nSurprisingly, in general, the casino itself is not very smoky to me, unlike many downtown properties (love that because- I'm not a smoker, and I don't want it sticking to my clothes, either). It's also not ghetto, either; lots of families come here. This is a locals' casino. There are two parking garages, as well as a parking lot in front. Head to the parking garage in the back for easy access ( ie. a shorter walk) to the movie theater (less crowded too).  Western theme with general casino design (no clocks inside, dim inside, no clear glass windows for fresh views to the outside).	3
	1532	Having been here a couple of times, I can see where visiting Cabo Wabo at night could be downright annoying. It caters to the dudebros.\n\nSo why five stars?\n\nBreakfast, my friend. It's the most important meal of the day, and Cabo Wabo had a damn good breakfast special. 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, potatoes, and toast usually sells for $9, but on my last trip it was on special for $4.99. Plus add a $4.99 bottomless mimosa special that lasted until 11, and the most important meal of the day gave me a happy happy buzz.\n\nConsider that finding breakfast under $15 in a sit-down restaurant on the Strip is becoming difficult, this was a great discovery.	4
	1533	"We got an awesome deal on Priceline to stay at Treasure Island for our spring trip.  The room was decently sized and well-decorated.  The beds were comfortable. The tv was a little small and our room had no fridge.  We wasted a ton of leftovers!  It did have a great view of the strip and the pool. \n\nThe casino area is small in comparison to some others, but it suited us just fine.  There are more slot machines than tables.  The hotel had a few restaurants, a variety of types and styles.  We did have a breakfast and dinner at the buffet.  Breakfast was much better than dinner and was only $16, cheap compared to most buffets.  We also tried Kahunaville, an island/jungle-themed restaurant/bar.  We enjoyed our dinner there and had great service, although we weren't satisfied with the expensive drinks that we ordered from the fruity cocktail menu.  In addition to the restaurants, there's a Starbucks, Ben & Jerry's, and a dance club.  We were very pleased with all that the hotel provided.\n\nThere were a few things to complain about... other reviewers mentioned the resort fee.  It's $20 a day and not optional.  For a guest who purchased the room on Priceline, an additional $20 a day was a big surprise.  It should already be included in the room price, if they have to raise the rates then they should.  It's sneaky to tack on that extra fee!  Also, our towels smelled awful.  The only way I can describe them is that they had a \""burnt\"" smell.  Lastly, the music and the waitstaff service in the pool area was really bad.  We spent a few hours at the pool every day, it was tough to get a drink brought to us and that music was like torture.  There was also a funny smell near the pool, made me think it wasn't clean enough."	2
	1534	*My 200th Review*\nTarbell's, you were a dream come true!\n\nThis is what 5 stars is to me-\nThe very best service. Every staff member was professional, personable, well groomed, prompt, and smiled often!\n\nThe restaurant itself was simple and elegant. Definitely a place I would recommend for a date or special occasion or anytime you want to be fancy! \n\nThe crowd was mostly retirees, but I took that as a sign that I was in the right place.  The other diners were very dapper and able bodied and seemed to clearly enjoy the finer things in life. \n\nThe food. Mmmmmm yes!! I had the scallops, and they were the best I've ever had. It came with a potato cake and seasonal vegetables, each bite equally delicious. The salmon was also excellent and grilled to perfection. Even the grill marks were absolutely perfect, which I admire because I can not do that myself! It was accompanied by mixed greens with an amazing honey glaze dressing, and potatoes another way- similar to shoe string pik nik sticks but much fancier and salty and mouth watering. We shared the caramel cheesecake for dessert, and that was probably the low point of the meal. Kidding!! Omg, I rarely eat dessert and this was worth.every.calorie!! Perfection! Not to sweet, not too dense, not too light, so full of flavor! The caramel sauce! My, my! I really can't wait to go back. I am very curious about the spaghetti and meatballs! And the profiteroles! I want to try the whole menu, each time it changes! \nThank you Tarbell's, for making my 30th birthday dinner amazing!\n\nEdit: I received a warm phone call from Ty 2 days after dining to inquire how my experience was. I can't say that has ever happened before even at other fine establishments. Very classy. Thanks Ty!	4
	1535	Traveled the distance after hearing rave reviews of this restaurant all the way from Los Angeles. We were not disappointed! You are treated like a rockstar by the cool Hard Rock Hotel staff, very modern yet welcoming decor, and incredible service. I only wish the restaurant's music had more of a classic rock soundtrack. My menu: Dirty Girl Scout martini, filet mignon with a surprise delicacy, to-die-for mac and cheese, and an Elvis Presley-inspired dessert. This is now a definite stop every time I'm in Vegas.	4
	1536	"$49 for 2pm tee-time last Sunday (for the \""Mountain\"" course) which included cart and about 20 range balls.  Beautiful Arnold Palmer designed course -- ravines, lakes, elevations, pure greens with nary a weed to be found, picturesque views.  Maintenance was definitely a primary focus.  Fairways were tight, outlined by trees, bushes...quarry laced OBs.  If you hit OB, good as gone.  Every rock looks like your ball.  \n\nPace of play was not bad due to the horrible conditions.  It was so windy it was like playing behind the engines of a Boeing 747.  \n\nCountry club facilities and treatment (despite 2 of us being yellow!  the other 2 guys looked anglo-saxon so no trouble there).  Employees packed our cart before teeing-off and then wiped down our clubs once we finished."	3
	1537	"They did not want our money :(\n\nWe had a LARGE party booked.\nI did not book it and it was not my party...\n\nBut I know restaurants and I know business.\nWhen 20+ people tell you they had a reservation and you have not clue what they are talking about, you push tables together and call in another server.\n\nInstead of doing anything reasonable, two women raised their voices at our host, questioning why he would bring so many people to their business. \n\nAll I heard was \""$1000?! NO THANK YOU!!\""\n\nWe simply left."	0
	1538	This is a restaurant on site  at fire sky, it's pricey and has an Italian themed food style, lots of attention, went for pizza, upscale pizza, not a kids taste, fresh baked or heated bread. Attentive service	3
	1539	The catfish is ok, but not any better than you will find at any Las Vegas buffet.  The fish batter was chewy...I've never had chewy fish batter.   Sides were very good and I liked the mom and pop atmosphere.  I love fried catfish, but I don't like the fish here.	1
	1540	1. Air quality in building is poor.\n\nWhen traveling on a budget, I will never skimp on sleeping accommodations again, especially in Las Vegas. We were in a non-smoking room, but the air circulation and quality in the establishment is just really poor and would wake up with a sore throat and an irritated nose. It was just plain gross and unhealthy. If you can afford it, go some place slightly nicer. \n\n2. Selection of food is not great.\n\nThe servers are really nice and service oriented, but there just is not a good selection of restaurants and cafes. \n\n3. House keeping is friendly. This is one redeeming quality of the place. They were sweet and prompt to deliver more towels and blankets when we requested them.	1
	1541	My fiance, my sister and me went here for an early dinner on a Friday night in February.  We'd heard great things and were eager to try it.\n\nEven though the place was practically empty, we had the WORST, most inattentive server I've ever had.  She spent most of her time chatting with the bartender.  Our drinks took forever, our hummus (while very good) took forever and the fact that we were so ignored that we never even got silverware, made the dinner unbearable.   \nWe were able to get one round of drinks and a hummus and antipasto platter before we decided we couldn't take it anymore and asked for the check.\n\nTo top it all off, I sent an email to the address on their website about the poor service and experience we had, and no one emailed me back. No one called me about it to apologize.  I will NEVER return here. Spend your money somewhere where they actually care about their customers.	0
	1542	My husband and I love Oregano's, it's one of our favorite restaurants. Today, we were disappointed in both the quality of the food and drinks, as well as the service. Our drinks tasted watered down, and for $6.99 a piece, we expect a little more. The serving size, which is usually really large (at least at the Gilbert location) was much smaller. Our server, Taylor, was not very attentive and asked my obviously NOT under aged husband for his ID. It took quite a while just to get our drinks be we were not asked at all if we wanted dessert. We felt very rushed. Over-all, not the best experience.	1
	1543	"Being from out of town, we had to check this place out. I ignored the mediocre reviews and paid the price. The food was average at best. The two guys working couldn't care less if we there or not. Cash only! I noticed throughout Pittsburgh many \""cash only\"" establishments. I understand avoiding taxes, but these places are also avoiding a lot if potential business. There are many better restaurants, believe the other reviewers that this dive is not special."	1
	1544	Great pad, delicious curry and the best sticky rice and mango. Small portions and pricey but definitely still great. The place itself was hard to find and doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside has a really nice authentic feel to it.	3
	1545	The hotel is nice and the rooms are nice but that's about it.  If you want good service or want to have fun, stay away from the Aliante!!!!  Most of the people at the hotel are not very nice or helpful.  The casino is the worst with the rudest pit bosses and no personality dealers.  It made for the worst time we have every had in a casino!  I now know why the casino was empty on Friday and Saturday night.	0
	1546	Reviewing for the pan style pizza.  \n\nHUGE, and kind of pricey.  The thin crust is too weak to hold up the topping, so I thought I'd get something with a little more oomph to hold up the goods, you know?\n\nIt weighed more than my dog, and for the most part was tasty.  I love that you eat one piece and are full for the rest of the day, but the crust was way burnt.  I needed to tear off about an inch of the crust because it was burned and rock hard.  Totally bummed.\n\nNext time, I think I'll stick to the thin crust and just take my chances of topping tumbling off.	2
	1547	I very seldom write negative reviews but unfortunately this one was needed. I went to Papago on a Wednesday night, there were probably 20 or so people in there. I sat down at a table and started browsing through the menu. 30 minutes later someone finally came up to me and asked what I wanted to drink and I ordered one of their beers. It came out pretty quick but the waitress just dropped it off fast and left. I finished the beer in about 10 minutes and wanted to order food and another drink but no one ever came back to help me. Other tables around me were being waited on and that same waitress (Younger blonde, don't know her name since she never told me nor even cared to serve me) was visiting them but not coming to me.\n\nI ended up sitting there for over an hour from the last time she came to see me. She never even came back to give me a bill. After that, I put the money for the beer on my table and walked out. I have never had service so bad before. Too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer. It is not like they were slammed or anything, just poor service. I unfortunately will not be back due to this experience.	0
	1548	Attentive staff. Room service was excellent but pricy. Lots to do to stay busy within the casino, which is now attached to the Aria Resort as well. Awesome pools!	3
	1549	Service sucks ,great food, wish manue in English, will come back just coz if the food , wait time about 45 min .	4
	1550	"Seriously, I don't understand the people hating on this show?   It might not be everyone's cup of tea but that doesn't make it bad.  \nThe sparkly costumes on the showgirls were absolutely gorgeous.  The dance numbers were fun and they were all so talented.  One of the performers could sing beautifully...she sang \""Home\"" from \""The Wiz\"".   It was dazzling but then again, I'm not quite as jaded as some reviewers who believe they're too cool for school.\n\nI agree with one reviewer who said that there is very little diversity among the performers.  There were quite a few Black and Latino men but hardly any women of color except one pretty brown-skinned lady.  \nAs to the complaints about the bodies of the performers...I didn't see anything wrong with them at all.  They all had terrific bodies and were in great shape.  I was actually thrilled to see that some of the showgirls had small breasts (what some folks here call \""flat-chested\"") because that isn't usually expected in a topless venue.  Women come in all shapes and sizes;  there is beauty in different types.  They were fit, talented and gorgeous so I don't get the catty comments about them being \""flat-chested\"".  That is better than seeing some overly inflated balloons or saggy udders.  There is an obsession with big boobs for some people but the overall package is more important.  Not putting down well-endowed ladies, just saying that small breasts are sexy too and yes, sometimes people want to see that for a change.\n\nThere was only one girl with large breasts compared to the others...she was about a D cup and very pretty, but they were all stunners.  \nThe two robot dancers were awesome, their moves reminded me of Michael Jackson in some ways.  \n\nOnce again, the showgirl costumes rocked my world...I can't imagine how heavy some of that stuff must be and what it takes to perform under hot lights.  I don't know if this is the true Vegas show experience because it was my first time (my Vegas virginity is no more!) but I really enjoyed it and would definitely love to come again.\n\nNext time I might even buy some popcorn and a candy bar before the show."	3
	1551	Carly's get's 4 for beer, 3 for food.. \n\nI loved the beer selection, it was great, Chimay on tap, very nice, Dogfish head, Raisin D'etre (last one) yum! \n\n The atmosphere was pleasant, I wished it could have been a bit darker, but overall the service is good and prompt.  With live music, some beer and friends, how can you go wrong right?\n\nWell, I had a Italian style panini, and I hate to say it was mediocre at best.  I've heard some of their other sandwiches are much better, but I didn't try anything else, so I can only judge this poor little sandwich.\n\nI'd say come here for the drinks, and if you get the munchies, they have many options in sandwich form, but I'd imagine it's a bit hit or miss on the food.  It couldn't hurt to eat prior and just save room for beer!	2
	1552	Since the management changed the place has gone down hill. Food is terrible. Never again.\nUsed to be a regular but bad cold food killed any chance of me returning.	0
	1553	Worst worst customer interaction. We order veg biryani and got EGG-Biryani. On same day Around 9:30pm I called them but no one  picked up. Next day I went and returned EGG biryani and got arrogant reply from owner. Very bad customer satisfaction. Me too offered biryani Money As a tip for rude behavior.  Please double check the order before taking parcel.... And hopefully you will not become victim of surprising parcel and rude customer interaction....	1
	1554	Wow! So good. I ordered because I love thai tea and when I saw it on the menu I had to have it. The tea was soo good. I wish I got 2, or a lifetime supply. And the food as well! Got free egg rolls, I'm usually not a fan of them but these were actually pretty good. The cream cheese wontons are the best I've had anywhere so far. And the orange chicken was good also! Delivery was fast also I will definitely order again.	4
	1555	Last minute Bloody Mary craving brought me and a girlfriend to Rao's one Saturday morning.   The line for the buffet was insanely long and Rao's empty tables were just what we needed.  Having eaten an incredible meal at Rao's in 2004 for a wedding reception at Caesar's I had high expectations but unfortunately something was amiss here.. \nOur Bloody Mary's were watery, my pizza boring, and my salad was meh.  I am sure if I had not gone on with incredible memories of a meal that happened nearly a decade ago I might have enjoyed it but this was a big disappointment.	1
	1556	We sat at the bar and had a great time.  The food was amazing!! Had the grande burrito.... So good. Try the skinny margarita... You won't be disappointed. Great place to visit!	4
	1557	This bar is the perfect place for me...lots of strong girly drinks and my man can grab a Primo (Hawaiian beer...I think) and a shot of Jameson. I opted to for the Lapu Lapu and felt it after a few sips (I think it only measured 2-3 skulls out of 5...I'm a wuss). \nThe environment is chill and you are still allowed to smoke (I don't smoke but I feel bars should have the choice whether or not to be smoke free...getting off my soapbox now). Melo is the nicest bartender (they are all good but Melo is my favorite). He is so down to earth and pours a mean drink. \n\nOverall this is one of my favorite bars to visit in town. Will be back soon :)	4
	1558	This review is for the buffet. Typical buffet food. I had saag, bombay potatoes, tandoori chicken, curry chicken and pakoras. I think they must leave out the spices for the buffet in case first timers come in. The saag was good, but it wasn't anything special. Bombay potatoes were just meh, This was however, the first Indian buffet I have been to where the tandoori chicken was not dry as a bone. It was actually juicy. Props for keeping the bones in the curry chicken, although there seemed to be more bone than meat. And the pakoras, bleh. \n\nI ordered a roti and a parantha. It was the weirdest roti I had ever seen. I am going to agree with Dean-Ryan S and say it looked like a mix of roti and naan. It wasn't horrible though. The parantha on the other hand was dry and almost burned. \n\nI was there by myself and the young guy and older woman were both very friendly. At first the guy was making conversation with me keeping me entertained but then he went in the back. \n\nI'd return perhaps for dinner. But since I don't live here I doubt that will happen.	2
	1559	Great Location for the South Park Area!  We ate outside on the umbrella covered deck at nice picnic tables!  The staff were friendly!  You go to the counter place your order, then David brings out  your food!  Very nice!  My burger was fixed just right (as I ordered it) and the flavor does beat many other places!  Great Red Onion on my Burger, though I'm not a fan of Kosher Pickles, on Burgers! \n\nA la Carte... Nice!  Some people may only want a Burger and not a side of fries!  It seems that they are more specialized : : Burgers and Sandwiches not trying to have a menu that is so wide that they are lacking in making the Burgers well!  I think most people will like this Burger and like the Restaurant!\n\nThe Burger was Good as in A -OK three yelp stars Good, maybe a little better when I think of all the Chains that can not make a decent burger!  I thought this burger was even better than some that cost more, though the flavor was three yelp stars compared to the few burgers I rate in the Four or Five Star range!  \n\nThe Onion Rings were not my preference, too thickly cut, TOOOOO much Cornmeal and Too much batter!  They did taste Fresh!  If you like this style of Onion Rings you'll like these!  For this kind of Onion Rings I guess these are pretty good, WAY better than many of this variety, only not what I prefer.  \n\nThe Sweet Potato Fries were poor and the Regular Fries were the opposite of good!  Huge Disappointments on all sides!  If I let the sides had factored in my yelp star rating of this review the overall rating would drop!	2
	1560	Horrible 7$ grown up grilled cheese!!!!!!!!!! I felt like I got ripped off!! I wanted to complian but said oh well. Sonic has better Grilled cheese for half the price!	0
	1561	I cannot recommend this restuarant   The food was fabulous but the service was incredibly slow--we were served in hour and 15 minutes after we sat down.  When we asked the waiter (who was scarce) about the wait he responded in a condescending manner that it was due to the thickness of the  steaks. I am a middle age guy who was eaten his share of fine cuisine and i don't appreciate being lectured on steak by a 22 year old waiter.  Worse than the long wait was the waiters absence after the long delay.  He made no attempt to rectify the situation or apologize in any way  It was dissapointing coming from a hotel that is suppose to be the pinnacle of hospitality in las vegas.  Steve Wynn would not have been happy with botero's performance on this evening.	1
	1562	Went to Vegas just for a foodie weekend with JR as the main item on our agenda, having made reservations about a month and a half before.  \n\nWe had made arrangements for the limo pick up but when we went downstairs there was an MGM escalade there so we thought it might've been for us. It turned out it wasn't but the driver called the MGM and told them she'd take us over. It was kinda funny cuz we asked her if the limo was nicer and she politely said 'um, no'. She turned out to be soo right cuz the escalade was gorgeous, luxurious and brand new. We took the limo home and as many of the other reviews have said, it's a bit of a clunker...although 'free is free' I suppose. ;-)\n\nWe were in awe walking through the mansion... never even knew it existed. Our hostess was wonderful and told us the history, etc. and even took some pictures of us in the atrium. The restaurant itself was no slacker either... gorgeous and all decked out in purple and pink hues. Even our table had charger plates w/pink ribbons and these cute little trinkets all over the table w/pink and diamond accents. We loved it!\n\nThen came the food.. oh, the food! I won't go into detail on each dish because I'm sure all the other reviews have covered it BUT I will just highlight my favorite dishes: The bread (yes, it's a dish!) was amazing... we each had like 5 or 6 pieces which is WAY too much but it was so hard to resist. They had this amazing bacon bread and this wonderful cheese bread... do not skip the bread cart.   My fav entree was the duck with seared fois gras w/cherries and almonds. This was cooked to PERFECTION and they must've cooked the duck in the fois gras jus because it had the same wonderful flavor. It was a pretty amazing dish!  The truffled langoustine ravioli was also pretty delicious.. and the most amazing part was the cabbage in the middle (shocker I know?!) but it was cooked perfectly and had this amazing savory flavor to it. I'm not a huge cabbage person but if it was always cooked like this I would be! ;-) \n\nIf there was one thing that I felt was a little lackluster it was the desserts. Don't get me wrong.. they were stunning and tasty but compared to the rest of the meal they just didn't feel special enough or taste out-of-this world enough. I had the same problem at French Laundry...no wow at the end. Although the mignardise wow'd us.. faboulous selection and all soooo delicious! \n\nThey also gave us this wonderful lemon cake to take home along w/a small picture book of JR, which was a really nice touch. \n\nAll in all JR did not disappoint and I can see why it would be worthy of it's 3 Michelin stars. I still think the FL was a bit better but would I come back here again? In a heartbeat. ;-)	4
	1563	Excellent job.  I had to have my apartment carpet cleaned for turnover after almost two years in the apartment with a pet.  I know the technician put a lot of extra effort into cleaning my carpet.  After he was done, the carpet was like new.  I got my full security and pet deposits back.  Great job!  Highly recommend.	4
	1564	2 words...bath bombs which are great for gifts or yourself.  Great customer service and frequent demonstrations of products...I mean they will demonstrate on each and every customer...that's quite a few bath bombs a day.	2
	1565	This is the review for the stupid Restaurant Manager in the Black Shirt from yesterday 6/14/2011\nYou are unprofessional. \nCame there with 2 European guests and they didnt accept their European IDs As a proove of Age. Both of them are 30 Years old. \nThats NOT costumer friendly at all. We European don't ASK any us people to Carry their Passworts with them in Europe. We accept your id As proove to. \nYou are unfriendly and your Company Rules are a joke. \nNobody who is in a different country like to Carry the passport 24/7 with them. \nI Went there at least once a Week since 4 month before Shopping and Wohle Never ever go there again. \nYou are a Great Restaurant Manager. Your Company rules are ridicoulos. \nI was so ashame about this unprofessional Manager. \nThanks for welcoming our guests from Europe in such unfriendly Way. \nI m sooooooo happy there are other Restaurants @ towns Square who accept an European driving license to get a Beer specialy Ehen they are 30 Years old!!!!\nThanks Blue Martini. Had a Great Time there!!!!!	0
	1566	"I finally decided to give this new ramen spot a try this weekend. The restaurant is located right next to Bachi Burger and is owned by the same people. I noticed the manager from Bachi running the shift at Shoku the evening of my visit. \n\nFood: I had the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra corn and nori. The broth was delicious without being overly salty, or overly bland. It was the perfect balance. I should have opted for extra chasu. There were only one or two pieces in the broth, but were melt in your mouth delicious. So, if getting Tonkotsu Ramen either get extra chasu, or opt for Buta-San. That is what my friend had, and the broth was almost identical to mine except his had much more meat /\""heavenly pork\"". The portions were  a bit larger than those at Monta's. Average price before any additions were between $8-10 a bowl.  We also had two orders of their gyoza which were pretty average. \n\nService: Our waitress was very sweet with a great attitude and willingness to accommodate additional requests for condiments. She forgot to put in our additional order of gyoza and was very apologetic once I reminded her. \n\nDecor: The restaurant was not very large. I'd say about six tables and six seats at the bar. It was clean with simplistic modern decor. Tables featured condiments that consisted of sesame seeds, shoyu, chili oil and gyoza sauce. They accommodated my request for Sriracha because I wanted a little bit of extra spicy kick in my broth.\n\nOverall, I am expecting Shoku to stick around and hopefully continue to improve and innovate their menu."	3
	1567	"Let's take every hipster clich\u00e9 and turn it into a bar! - said the owners of Dive.  \n\nAtmosphere:  they could've taken one bar stool away so people could have room to get up and down.  They wanted you trapped.  Pabst beer can lights that illuminate a list of $8 beers.  I'll let you figure out the irony in that.  Empty beer and wine bottle chandeliers.  Minimal wall art except a few staples from actual dive bars (antique ads, funny signs, etc) and some decent artwork.  Everything clashed.  It made no sense. 2 stars just because if they removed the tack it would actually be a very nice place.\n\nFood:  bland nachos that were soggy by the time they got to us.  $16 Mac and Cheese.  How that can cost so much I am not sure.  Especially since they do not list which five cheeses they use.  It could be different powdered cheeses or variants of cheddar.  Who knows? 1 star for crazy prices and letting our nachos sit when the place was dead.\n\nService:  when we ordered after looking at the menu for a long while the bartender asked us \""that's it, nachos?  After all of that time looking at the menu?\"" His pompous attitude set us back a bit.  At that moment we realized we recognized this bartender from another restaurant in town.  He gave us the exact same attitude because we wanted Jack Daniels in a whiskey bar.  Sometimes people just want to stick what they're comfortable with.  Terrible social skills.  \n\nA small group next to us they seemed to understand his and his brothers attitude (I think they were brothers.  I didn't feel like getting another snarky comment by asking) and shared it however they were the only ones out of the maybe 10 sitting at the bar. 1 star due to their better than thou attitude.\n\nCocktails:  dive bars do not serve martinis.  Repeat they do not.  However this did so we tried a couple.  The martinis were actually very good.  Pear martini and peach martini.  Delicious and the price was average for martinis so they get 5 stars there.\n\nFor a Saturday night this place was dead and it's easy to see why.  Why should consumers take the extra time to drive further away from town for martinis and expensive food when there are two actual dive bars within walking distance?  Plus there are a slew of other restaurants and bars closer to town that are full of much better food, service, and atmosphere.  Go somewhere else.  Unless you're just looking for a quiet place to drink where the bartenders like to put you down."	2
	1568	"So apparently the oven is brought over from Italy.  Pretty impressive stuff here I must say.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for their pizza.  The only thing I can say is their crust is pretty good and I'm not that into carbs so maybe that oven did do some good work.  However, stay away from their Pizza Fritta -- totally not worth it.  It's like a eating a hugh \""Cha Siu Bow\"", you Dim Sum eaters know what I'm talking about.  Needless to say we didn't finish the Fritta.  I like the decor of the place nice sports bar feel with a modern twist.  Our service was decent though it seemed like I had to ask for more water every time.  Just leave the damn water jug on the table I'll handle this! :) - Enjoy!"	2
	1569	Went three times. Wanted to like it but just couldn't. Pizza was bland. Pasta sauce was tasteless. Chicken Vesuvio sauce was way too oily, chicken was a little overcooked, and I just couldn't bring myself to like that it was served with smashed potatoes.	1
	1570	"With already cheap prices, there are ALWAYS discounts and promotions offered online and/or in stores. If you have a Gap Brands Inc. - Banana Republic, GAP, Old Navy - credit card, you receive even more discounts like 10% off on Tuesdays (some promotions will be store credit card specific). Since I have an Old Navy CC, I'm constantly receiving emails and mailers for 30-40% off purchases. Recently, they've been running a \""Super Cash\"" promotion where you receive a certain amount of money off your next purchase of X amount (for example, $10 off your $25 purchase). They do several promotions that are online only, so it's worthwhile to check out their website periodically for additional discounts and styles not sold in stores. Standard shipping (7-10 business days) is always free on your purchase of $50 or more.\n\nTheir product quality is just okay. \""Hit or miss\"" is probably the best way to describe Old Navy. There are times I can't find a single item to purchase and sometimes will be the exact opposite. The life span can be limited, but I've also been fortunate to find pieces that stay in my closet for a while. I usually inspect the items and decide whether it's worth buying.\n\nThe primary reason I shop at Old Navy is for the prices, but it's also for the fit and availability of current styles. I just wish everything was more consistent! Although a lot of the pieces and styles fit me well, it really does depend on each item. For sizes, I'm all over the board. Although, I love the fact that they offer tall sizes online! Being taller and having longer limbs makes it really hard to shop anywhere.\n\nI visit this location because of its vicinity to my house and overall convenience. I do like that it's usually pretty clean and not too busy. The associates are usually really nice and sometimes helpful. However, I don't enlist in their help often because I know they keep most of their product on the floor and I know my way around the store."	3
	1571	"I agree with everything that people have said in terms of the positives. BUT, be aware that the restaurant charges the \""L.E. Tax\"" of 10% to your entire bill, on top of the sales tax. What is the \""L.E. Tax\"" you ask? Perhaps some sort of transportation tax used to help pay for the monorail or some other city municipal service? Nope-- I asked the server, and he explained that it's a \""Live Entertainment Tax\"" that the restaurant imposes to pay for the performers you see during your dinner. Wait, the same performers who are performing in the show next door that I just paid $135 to see? And why is this a tax if it's not a government charge? Well, they're actually just charging you 10% more for everything on the menu without telling you, and taking the money. Really sleazy, in my opinion. They should just charge 10% more for the food if they really need that money... at least you know how much you're paying for a dish, then."	2
	1572	I call Doug and he send his Co worker Ken, he did a very good job and fast the most important is he  gave me a very good price. I'm very happy with his work.	4
	1573	The wait is crazy here so don't go if you want a quick meal or arrive hungry! Go early or else you'll wait for at least an hr! Food is made to order so that's another 15-30 mins wait. With that said, I really enjoyed the food here, the portions are huge, sharing food is highly recommended. Got the The Tractor Driver Combo with French Toast and it was delicious. I would highly recommend this place if you have the time. \n\nParking: Parking lot is free but it's a maze to find the entrance.	3
	1574	This was by far my favorite hotel that I visited while in Vegas. It was breathtaking. The ceilings were painted like the Sistine chapel. Most of the stores and restaurants were way out of my price range, but there's nothing wrong with a little window shopping. Every hour or so performers put on a show with singing, dancing, and a little interactive acting. There is a little river with boats you can ride on and a guy or gal rowing the boat will sing to you in Italian. Very cool!	4
	1575	"Stayed here for a night because we decided to stay in Vegas an extra night and well, it really is \""just a place to stay\""\n\n[-] first, it took us forever to figure out where the heck we were going\n[-] and where the elevators are and where they lead\n[-] the room was small and pretty gross\n[-] I didn't feel comfortable sitting on the carpet\n[-] the toilet HAD NO TOILET SEAT COVER and was pretty dirty\n[-] room was poorly lit (not enough lights)\n[-] the closet doesn't even have any doors covering it\n[-] casino is sooooo tiny\n\nUghhhh, I never wanna come baaaaaaack!"	0
	1576	"I first stayed here 20 years ago and I thought the room was incredible...that was 20 years ago. \n\nWhen I checked in here the woman at the front desk encouraged me to pay 20 bucks to upgrade my room to the newly remodeled tower. I was not going to do it but she then said, \""Everyone in your group did the upgrade and you want to be near them!\"" Nothing like a little peer pressure at the front desk. So I took the upgrade. \n\nI could not believe that my room had been recently remodeled...it still seemed old. I probably got suckered into the upgrade so the hotel could make more money. The room is very big...there was also a powder room and a large bathroom. I could have probably lived in the bathroom, if I wanted too. I really did not need the powder room but if my wife was with me she would have definitely enjoyed this. \n\nMy iron was complete broken...it looked like someone cracked the metal and the water was leaking out of it. I called down to housekeeping and received a brand new iron...that made me feel special. \n\nAlso someone Australian Guy left his money, air travel documents and passport in my safe. The hotel had to send up two security guards to remove the items...it felt like one of those movies where I get whacked because I knew too much...I called my co-worker when they arrived and told them if they lost contact with me to run for there life and call the police. \n\nThere are so many hotels in Vegas...I would only stay here in the future if I had to stay with my group or if the rooms were free."	1
	1577	"The best piece of advice you can really give to visitors of the Royal Mile, would be that if the place is overtly Scottish, it will almost certainly be shit, so avoid. The World's End isn't quite as bad as the likes of Rabbie Burns Cafe and Whiski, but it's still naff, grubby, and grasping for every last penny it can get from grinning middle-aged Canadians with cameras round their necks.\n\nIt also has a slightly seedy, sinister atmosphere that I just can't put my finger on, but which at least makes it a bit more memorable than the \""och aye the noo\"" persona shoved down our throats on Edinburgh's least culturally interesting street.\n\nBarely deserving of averageness, but better than a boarded up unit. Probably."	2
	1578	The rooms are great and you can usually get great deals online. They always have great concerts going on and in the summer they have concerts out at the pool which is like a beach. They have stuff for the kiddos to do like the Shark Reef.	4
	1579	"My boyfriend had a beautiful, silk down comforter that he bought second hand before moving to Arizona.  The tag was in Japanese, so we didn't know how to properly clean it.  I took it to Uptowne Drycleaning and had a 15 minute conversation with the girl about the fact that it was silk down, that my boyfriend was IN LOVE with the thing, and that I just wanted it as clean as possible without ruining it.  She took my number and said if \""Dry Clean Dave\"" had any questions, he would call me.  Four days later when I went to pick it and the rest of my dry cleaning up, they couldn't find it.  The next day I got a call from Dry Clean Dave.  He put it through a normal \""processing cycle\"" and all of the silk filling \""had become detached and clumped up in a ball.\""  He assured me over the phone that they were able to get the filling stretched out and I would be happy with the outcome.  When I asked if he had been told it was silk, he avoided my question and finally admitted that he had no clue it was silk, but that he treats \""everything the same as if it's polyester.\""  When I got the comforter back, it was seran wrapped so I couldn't really see anything except that it was clean.  I got it home and none of the filling went to the edge of the blanket at all, and the tag was no longer legible. This is a one-of-a-kind.  we can't even find a replacement online.  We do know that Princess Diana used to use the same brand, so we can assume it's a very expensive blanket.  \n\nWhen I took the comforter in to the drycleaner, the tag was legible, though in Japanese.  The girl actually looked at the tag and commented on the fact it was in Japanese."	0
	1580	I wish I could give this 0 stars! Arizona Republic is awful; they wrongfully charge you without your consent!!! Terrible customer service department too!!! I hate this company and am extremely sorry that I ever gave them any business in the first place!!!! Do yourself a favor, and don't get this newspaper!!!!!!	0
	1581	It's an antique mall and it's huge.  Waaay back in the day this used to be *the* place to find Beanie Babies.  They have lots of glass displays and definitely a fair share of furniture.  They are a pretty decent place to spend a couple of hours on a weekend.	3
	1582	This used to be our go-to delivery place, but they must have changed owners or management or something. Regardless, the pizza comes cold, the cheese is partially melted, it tastes frozen, and tonight they took 2 hours before I called the manager and refused delivery. Late, cold, crappy pizza? No thanks, I'll spend my cash elsewhere.	0
	1583	Fun place to spend an afternoon.	3
	1584	"i had such low expectations since every other wolfgang restaurant i've been to sucked ass.\n\nto be safe, we ordered the chinois chicken salad, which i hear he \""invented\"" and a pizza (we got the one with chicken, garlic, and parsley or something like that). \n\nwe also got some beer just in case the food sucked and we had to get our caloric intake from alcohol. luckily, the food wasn't that bad and we were mildly surprised. \n\nthe entire place was empty at around 5pm on a sunday. strange. good service."	2
	1585	This is THE place to be Sunday afternoons.\n\nLive music, good food and drinks on the back patio.\n\nIt doesn't get any better than this!	3
	1586	I am absolutely please with living here. If I are kind to them they will bend over backwards for you! My faucet in my sink was too shallow to do dishes and bam two days later I had a brand new faucet paid by them. Dryer wasn't up to par. Boom that day brand new dryer. Allergic to bees. Same day they had an extinguisher.\n\nNot to mention my 1 bedroom rent was the absurd cheapest in the 5 mile radius.\n\nQuiet too!!!	4
	1587	The people that work here are idiots! I ordered 5 footlong subs and they couldn't get any of them right despite me standing over them directing them. And yes, this Subway is cheap, cheap, cheap on the toppings!!!	0
	1588	I don't know why this place got 4 stars. I'm from SoCal where Thai restaurants are everywhere and I've been to Thailand so I can tell how good is the taste of Thai food. This place here is even under average compares to the ones in California. \n\nI ordered Tom Yum, Pad Thai and fried rice. I left over more than half of them. I think their taste is similar to Thai Basil, so terrible. I live right at ASU but I'd rather drive to Yupha's to enjoy my favorite basil seafood eggplant and their special fried rice, or crab fried rice at Thai Rama. \n\nThe service was pretty good though. 2 stars for the service.	1
	1589	Rented here for a couple years. Hostile managers, unnecessary confrontations. Rented month-to-month before departure, and they never made the exit process clear, though I told them my planned departure time six and four months in advance. Slapped me with an extra months rent ($900), claiming I'd missed some evacuation notice deadline. I didn't pay, and they've been pursuing me for a $4000 claim since!	0
	1590	Easily the worst casino on the strip! The new management that bought the place a couple of years ago are running this place into the ground. On the surface it looks good with good details, but the food and especially the hotel service are terrible. Example: The front desk asked me if everything was ok. I said, no and explained my issues. He smiled and did nothing. Awesome. Your money is better spent elsewhere. Its a big town with many better places that you can drop your vaca money.	0
	1591	Joes Farm Grill breakfast tacos. Where have you been my whole life. These three tacos are so good with chicken potatoes eggs and seasoned perfectly. I love the beans that you get with the meal. You will be full after these tacos, they are not extra large but i assure you they are enough for a large man to be full from breakfast. I will be back for them for sure. I think they were about 8 dollars or so.	3
	1592	So my wife and I schedule back to back dental cleanings our grills are in good condition no drama. Talk to the girl on the phone we dont want x-rays have x-rays from old dentist. We filled out our 10 pages of paper work a week earlier to make sure we didnt have to wait in the lobby.  Arrive day of cleanings girl has 2 slip boards says you need to fill out paperwork new patient  I waited a few seconds then she said oh you filled out your paperwork already.  Just need your ID and insurance card. OK!  Dental assistant takes me back to start cleaning wait u need XRAYS. I said no I just need my teeth cleaned today.  The Dentist comes in and says yes we need XRAYS. I said look if you cant clean my teeth today. We'll just reschedule so we could just get out of there. OH JOY! WOW!   What a complete waste of time.  We wont be going  back!	0
	1593	Italian night club was gross. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Balance of sandwich tasted like onions and mayo mushed between two slabs of so-so bread. \n\nLoud music.  Staff was somewhat brusque.\n\nI find Subway far better.	1
	1594	This place is, not great in my opinion.. I got a gel mani and a pedi for 45$ but the quality is crap. She didn't even paint the whole nail on my toes completely and I'm pretty sure they reuse all their utensils which is HIGHLY unsanitary. Only benefit about the pedi that I enjoyed is she exfoliated my legs with an orange sugar scrub. It smelled amazing. The gel manicure he tried to send me off with blotchy messy work! I made him redo the entire manicure and they still aren't up to par. It's all uneven at my cuticle and still a tad blotchy. \n\nPretty much, if you want your money's worth, go somewhere else.	0
	1595	Friends and I made a trip to Las Vegas for a friends' 30th birthday during this past weekend, February 16th - 19th. We rented a suite in the West Tower at The Luxor for the weekend and on Saturday evening we reserved a table at this club, LAX. \n\nOne of their representatives approached us as we were dining at the caf\u00e9 downstairs offering us a deal for a table that night and it was a two-for-one bottle deal, which we took advantage of. The deal was that we would get a bottle for free, however we would still be obligated to pay the service and tax on the second bottle, which we happily agreed to. Since there were 13 of us all together, 7 girls, 6 guys, the total bill came out to about $760.03. \n\nOur waitress's name was Christina. When we arrived, we were kindly helped and checked at the door and escorted to our table. We were seated for about 15-20 minutes before our set-up was completed. Christina had brought over the tab and went over it all with my friend. He decided to upgrade our bottles to Hennessey and Grey Goose for an additional $110.00 fee. Another 10 - 15 minutes later, Christina finally brought our bottles to the table. When she began pouring drinks, she started with the Hennessey. She peeled off the wrapper and poured drinks. However, when she brought the Grey Goose bottle (which most of us were drinking) the bottle came to the table WITHOUT the wrapper on it. All she had to do was uncork the bottle. I was a bartender for two years and I know what the bottle looks like packaged out of the box. There is a blue wrapper that needs to be peeled off before the cork is removable. There was no wrapper when she brought it to the table. After the server had poured the first round of shots, I began serving the drinks, as there were so many people with us. We finished the bottle of Grey Goose within the first hour we were there and no one had gotten drunk. The vodka was heavily diluted and every one of us that drank it noticed it after not having felt any effects of the liquor, whatsoever. \n\nI do not recommend coming to this club, as the other people posting are also right about the table situation... the whole top floor was EMPTY, no one was up there. But all the small booths on the bottom were over crowded and almost all filled. With the price you pay, you'd expect to be put upstairs in a bigger more spacious table. IMO, of course. \n\nOh, and the 1 star was because they kept our supply of pineapple juice unlimited.	0
	1596	One of buffet from buffet of buffet,  get here for breakfast,  they had international choice to choose,  so pick whatever you are in the mood for except for Mexican, soup and salad bars are closed.	3
	1597	They remodeled this place which turned out nice, i still remember when i was younger and this was the place we used to stay back in day when there was no Fremont Street Experience i was happy with my $20 rolls of quarters playing video games while my parents gambled. Came here to visit the Jerky store which was originally here on the 3rd floor then moved to the Las Vegas Club across the street and then moved back here to it's original spot, it's still under construction but opened. This place for me still gives out the old school downtown Vegas vibe along with Binion's (formely the Horseshoe) Still a cool place to visit and i do recommend Island Sushi to eat some ono food like the bento box.	2
	1598	So excited Fox brought the concept to Tempe! Such a great place to have a low key night with friends and be in a great atmosphere. There are ping pong tables and couch seating areas with little fires for you to lounge and just enjoy the company. A huge space too, so you can really just hang out and not feel overly crowded, even when it is crowded! \n\nThe service was beyond slow, so I'm hoping that is just new staff jitters and they will work it out. We ordered food, and the food came out before my glass of water that I had ordered from our server. And, it took almost 20 minutes between her grabbing our card and check off of the table to bringing it back to us to sign and leave. \n\nI'll definitely be coming back though. A great location and a great place to meet friends in a pretty central location but avoid the college craziness that Mill Ave can be!	2
	1599	Crossover! \n\nNot a great place to find any woman clothing, but you'll find everything for the guys. Quite disappointed in their shoe collection. They have everything you can find at every other shoe store. \n\nWhenever my friends and I pop in here for a visit, the workers are either hitting on me or on my friends. Very professional. Workers are too busy on their iPhones texting or changing the music playing in the store.	1
	1600	************Like Eating In The Back Seat Of A Yugo***********\n\nThe servers can't even maneuver between tables.\nYOU WILL rub elbows with the neighboring table.\n\n***********Use To Be A Top Notch Italian Restaurant*********\n\nIt seems they went on an aggressive expansion plan......about 5 years ago.\nThe food quality slipped.......BIG TIME.\nPrices rose.......BIG TIME.\n\nNow its kinda of..........an over priced Olive Garden.\n.......and in my opinion Olive Garden is DRECK .	1
	1601	"This Walmart is in my \""hood\"" and I will seriously only shop here if I'm desperate and can not wait until Frys or Target opens.  \n\nDirty store - Check\nWait 30 minutes in line to check out - Check\nNeed to \""hire\"" someone to do some work for you - Check ( a quick scan of the parking lot, and you'll find your workers )\nSome woman smoking \""something\"" in a bathroom stall - Check  \n( \""security\"" proceeded to kick her out of the store within minutes of someone narcing on her.  I was standing in the customer service line waiting to get a refund when everything went down.  You could her her yelling from outside the bathroom. )\n\nI will drive my happy azz 8 miles to Mesa Riverview's Walmart than drive the 1.5 miles to this location."	0
	1602	"Damn! Somebody beat me to my \""Happiest Place on Earth\"" title? What are the chances?\n\nPoint is, I am a big fan of BevMo. Why you ask? They have booze for days, that's why. \n\nThey have those cool little Heineken mini-kegs that actually work like kegs, and all kinds of great foreign beer. Employees I have dealt with have all been extremely helpful and surprisingly knowledgable about the drinks they're slinging. \n\nRespek!"	3
	1603	Qdoba started out fairly well but has gone downhill in our opinion.\nThe portions are unpredictable and more often small.\nI would like more information about where their beef and chicken comes from.\nThe meat is usually cold.\nThe people behind the counter are distant and uninterested in me being there.  I would just like a smile and some friendliness.   They probably need to pay a little bit more and nurture some happy employees.\nThe atmosphere is cold and uninviting while the view at this place isn't half bad.\nIt is very clean so they get a good mark there.\nWe stopped going here and opting for locations that have hot food, larger servings, nicer environment and friendlier people.	1
	1604	"I've been to this location and the mesa location over a dozen times. The first time I had \""a lovely bit of salmon\""...it was amazing. The second time I had the pepper steak, which was also amazing...but let's face it beef is easy. So every other time I've been I have \""a lovely bit of salmon\"" because there's just no place on earth that does salmon better.\n\nI went so far as to bring adults (people over 45) with me one time. They loved it too; even though I have to admit it's a bit noisy and young-ish in the atmosphere....but not too young. ~I know all the songs playing, but many of them are older than I am."	4
	1605	Such a high end venue but with a laid back atmosphere! Greg, Jeff & Patrick were so generous and helpful in providing our reunion's needs. Service both thumbs up. Actually, staff went beyond in service to accommodate our 80 guest party!!! Rearranged the whole mezzanine for us and set up a good sound system and video screens.\nLots of great food! Wish I tried them all. I had 2 dishes: excellent calamari and spicy chicken wings! \nThanks, Republic for an unforgettable evening! We had a ton of fun!!!	4
	1606	Came here for dinner tonight.. since its 4th of July my mom and I decided to feast on some BBQ.\n\nIt's been awhile since I last came here, and I had lunch back then, so this time we ordered off the dinner menu.\n\nWe split the 3 combo plate & had the St. Louis ribs, brisket, and burnt ends. We also had a choice of 2 sides;  we got the mashed potatoes with gravy and veggies.\n\nThe entire order was disappointing. I remember now why I don't really like red meat anymore. The BBQ sauce wasn't that good. The side of mashed potatoes was very sorry tasting and the veggies were very sorry looking (probably came out of a can and just warmed up).  The only thing we enjoyed was the apple sweet tea and bread that came before the main course.\n\nThey weren't that busy when we came around 6pm, so the servers were attentive. I also liked how our server gave us a sample of sweet tea as well before placing an order. \n\nHowever the food was disappointing. I doubt I will be making a repeat visit.	1
	1607	Without a doubt the worst service and the lousiest cappuccino I have ever experienced.I dropped in here just before noon last Thursday for a cappuccino and maybe breakfast / brunch while my wife was at a seminar at the Hilton up the road.I had checked this breakfast place out earlier in the week and it looked promising.I ambled in and sat down at the big breakfast bar.The female server came straight over and said,what can I get you to drink?I must have walked into a night club or a dive bar because that's their opening line.I ordered a cappuccino and she left a menu in front of me almost as an afterthought when she brought back my coffee.It came in a square glass mug,2 inches of black coffee topped by 3 inches of white foam.I would need a bloody straw to drink that.I asked her to pour the cappuccino into a porcelain mug which at least should be round.She was very annoyed by my request and made a mess of the liquid transfer.The cappuccino tasted like shit so I was not sticking around for breakfast....that's for sure.This is not the person I would want greeting my valued customers.My wife and I enjoyed superb cappuccinos at The Chopshop just a block away the next morning.	0
	1608	Edit: The people in charge at NYPD really take care of their customers. The person in charge of NYPD saw that we had a bad experience and contacted me to make it right. I really appreciate this in an establishment, and though this experience still happened, I know this isn't the kind of thing that happens here often. \n\nI really like the food at NYPD. I always have, as indicated by my previous review...but my visit there tonight was truly horrific...as far as the service went. The BF and I went there to have a quick -ish dinner before he had to go take a test. We got there at 5 and needed to leave at 6....that should be enough time for us to eat.....we generally spend about 40 minutes in a restaurant, aside from fine dining. When we got there, there were 2 other tables seated...that's it. We came in to get their special which was a half appetizer, a 3 topping 10 inch pizza, and a dessert for 18$, which I saw online earlier today. I asked the waitress about the special and she said she was unsure what the details were, but that she would check on it and get back to us. She came back and told us that the deal was a half app, two 10 inch one topping pizzas, and a dessert for 18$. I then said 'It is?...well ok....' and we ordered that. We then proceeded to wait for 30 minutes for our app, while hearing the manager yell at our waitress about how she messed up the special. Now, I didn't want her to be yelled at, but it wasn't our fault that she made the mistake. I somewhat felt like the manager thought we were trying to get things for free from them, but we really weren't, we would have been content sharing the 10 inch pizza. Anyway, after our app came out (which was good) we waited another 20 min or so until we had to ask for our pizza to just be boxed up along with our dessert because we were 'in a rush.' The waitress said she was sorry she didn't know we were in a rush.....but we hadn't said anything because we WEREN'T in a rush to begin with.....we became in a rush after spending an hour waiting for service and a pizza...meanwhile people came in and ordered food to go and left without us receiving anything. I found this to be unacceptable as the restaurant was fairly empty. So we get our food (in boxes....couldn't even eat at the restaurant) and we got our bill and it was for 25$. I do not know how our bill became 25$ when it was supposed to be 18$ for the deal....but we did not have enough time to argue over it so we just paid it. That was the last straw that made me fairly upset with my experience and really turned me off of (at least) this location of NYPD. As I said, the food was good....but the service was so bad that it didn't made up for it. It caused us to have a stressful and unpleasant experience.....	2
	1609	This swanky and hip restaurant and wine bar was our first stop to eat after a long drive into town from Vermont on a Friday night.  Make sure you check out the photos, because the highlight, for me, was the charcuterie plate that was packed full of spicy Italian meat and pate deliciousness.  I can't recall everything else we ate, but the service was excellent and the server made some excellent wine recommendations for us.  \n\nThis place will fill up, so give yourself some extra time if you're arriving off the street during dinner hours, but that said, I thoroughly enjoyed our experience.	3
	1610	Went last night for the first time. Loved the food, loved the place as did all the people who packed the place.	4
	1611	I am not a regular coffee drinker but occasionally enjoy a cup. This was my first time trying Dunkin Donuts coffee.  We stopped into this location while waiting to be seated at a restaurant in Town & Country. It was just a plain ol' cup of coffee. Nothing special, adding just a little cream and sugar. This was not Sucksbucks for sure. It was better. Smooth and toasty not the charred essence of the other guys. If given a side by side choice, I'll choose Dunkin.	3
	1612	Worst place ever!!! Took my daughter there for her first swim lesson, instructor not only makes fun of her name but then won't give her back to us when she in pool and crying and instead dunks her under water!!! I have never seen my 4 year old daughter so frightened or cry so hard or shake like that!!! This is supposed to be a place where she was going to learn to swim and instead she is traumatized! Parents don't trust this place with your babies!!!	0
	1613	The best experience ever! I shopped around for many painters to repaint my house\nAnd am so pleased that I used Paint Masters! They came 4 times to perfectly match our house color. They came with a huge group of painters, covered everything that did not need painting (plants, bushes, ect.). In just four days they power washed our home, prepped it, fixed the stucco, painted the house, doors, perimeter walls and our trim. No money was asked up front, only when the job was fully completed. Extremely careful with our property and plants ! No splashes anywhere. It was just a perfect job and I am extremely satisfied. Highly recommend !!!	4
	1614	We stopped in here to get out of the rain. Sat at the bar. Ordered beers which, eventually, grudgingly, arrived. Asked for menus. Twice. Waited half an hour with closed menus and expectant looks, while multiple servers and bartenders passed us without acknowledgement. Gave up, paid the check and moved on. \n\nService is unhurried in Montreal -- that's part of its charm -- but the staff here just plain ignored us. Don't bother. There are so many superior alternatives.	0
	1615	I had not been here since 07 and it was fabulous then and still is. I cannot wait for summer so we can enjoy the beautiful patio seating.  \n\nFood was delicious and perfect portion size. \nWe had crab cakes to start... light and tasty.\nRow 11 pinot nior smooth and flavorful.\nThe salmon melted in my mouth.\n\nIt was a busy night and service was good. \n\nSeating was cozy and personal perfect for our first date	4
	1616	"Bleh!  Worst frozen yogurt ever.  All chemicals and water.  In fact, the worst I have ever had.\n\nI tried two flavors: vanilla and chocolate.  You can always tell really bad frozen yogurt from good frozen yogurt.  Good frozen yogurt will be completely white and made from real milk.  Bad frozen yogurt almost has a cum like color to it.  Off white and you can see through it.  Oh, and It's served at this place.  Basically powder that's mixed with water.\n\nI decided to have my usual: oreos with nuts and chocolate sauce.  I thought it was ok right up until my husband said, \""That is the most foul smelling yogurt I have ever smelled.\""  He was right.  At $10 bucks a cup, I felt obligated to eat all of it.  And it made me sick.\n\nI give them an extra star because they serve crepes that are pretty good and very close if you're staying at Mandalay.  Slightly expensive but worth it since there are no crepes in close proximity.  Unless you want to walk.  Which I usually don't.  Because I always lose my money on the first day.  I end up doing the depression trudge the rest of the trip and punish myself with this chemical slop."	1
	1617	I love this place SO much. If I could, I would find a way to hug the store on a regular basis.\n\nThe owners are very respectful of their clientele and always ready with a friendly recommendation. My favorite part is how both owners seem to remember that I'm the guy who bought a certain game back in 2011 and did I know that the expansion was just released?\n\nI've read reviews here that had negative experiences with people in the store but I refuse to believe that it was either of the owners who gave them a hard time. I've been shopping here for many years and not once have I been made to feel anything other than cared for and valued as a customer.\n\nI would encourage anyone looking for a board game or Magic cards or the like to stop by and see why Game Depot is head and shoulders above its competition as a FLGS in the Phoenix metro area.	4
	1618	The food is ok but if you like service without a smile then you will also find that here!	2
	1619	Their Asian inspired food was delicious. If that wasn't enough to get a person to come back their cocktails are always so creative, and taste superb. Having now gone here since they have opened I have always loved the new seasonal menus that they come up with. Have yet to be disappointed!	4
	1620	So its Sunday night and in the middle of a little three day get away in this beautiful cold city in the beautiful cool country of Canada.   I decide to check this place out by myself, leaving my wife and daughter in the hotel room to sleep early.  Its been around seven years or so since I came to this club, back then it was called the Dome, and it was an ok spot.\n\nWell they have turned it into quite a sleek and very Euro and chic club.  \nI get there and there is a substantial line.  Its only around 10:30 or so and inside there is quite a bit of a crowd already.   The music is House and Techno and the DJ was as good as I have heard anywhere.  I ordered a Red Bull and relax in a corner.   After about a few minutes I start to jam and again noticed that most of the people did'nt really know how to dance to this kind of music, but did'nt care much, just happy to finally have a good forty minutes of grooving to the best dance music out there.  At about 11:45 to midnight the place started getting very crowded and I left a little past 12:30.    Overall one of the cooler clubs I have personally been in, and definitely will be back next trip out here.  The place is pretty much the Montreal version of Boston's Roxy or The Estate, and pretty much the same cover charge and drink prices...	4
	1621	Best Vietnamese food in the west valley!  Price is right too, and the owner and young servers are friendly.  Try number 52 for a special treat.  Includes beef,shrimp,egg roll, noodles and salad greens and sprouts with a dipping sauce. \n Even served  cleverly in a boat.  Lots of flavor, very fresh....and we are picky.	4
	1622	I had came here for some quick dinner and ordered a beef congee, chinese broccoli, and singapore mei fun. The beef congee was bland. I think they forgot salt. The chinese broccoli did not seem fresh, and the mei fun was ok, but also bland. Overall, service sucked. I didn't know if they wanted me to really feel like I was in China and wanted bad service. The waiter certainly didn't know how to be a waiter. The price was high when I think about the quality of the meal and the quality of the service I received. I would rather go to the one at Mandalay Bay.	1
	1623	I give it high marks.    An outstanding dive bar.   I spent a weeks vacation there in December of 04.  I have fond memories of this place and the rugged female bartender.    If the Phillies play the Diamondbacks in the playoffs which is very possible I will make my gallant return!	4
	1624	Again, I want to LOVE all thing Mill Ave., but this was my second time to Sucker Punch Sally's and I'm still not thrilled by the food. However, I do give them full credit for being local and bringing a unique business back to Mill Ave. so major props for that.\n\nThey are STILL on a temporary menu (they had an even smaller menu a month ago) and perhaps I am ordering the wrong things from the lunch side - but everything has just been OK. I'm hoping this too is temporary.\n\nI do love that they are open 24 hours for the bar/college crowd - maybe next time I need to dine there after a night of partying and order breakfast??\n\nUntil then, I will choose someplace else for lunch or breakfast. But I'm not giving up, I'll give them another shot in a few months once the full menu has been released and they've had more time to perfect their menu and style!	2
	1625	Great place for a business lunch or dinner.   Very classy and great food.  Chef here is very good.  If you need a special place for a date, this is it.  Hidden, forgotten, you could hide away here and live like a king and queen.  The food is stellar, prices fair, views and decor well above average.  The only question is who shall I meet there, and are they paying?   Girls, go, suggest it, have your man pay, he will be fine.  Guys, take a date here, its not that expensive, but its cozy and shes sexy.   Highly recommended.  not 3 star Michelin stuff like further down the strip, but great value for what you get.  4.75 star here, but I will give it 5 since they are consistant and classy! Highly recommended.   For lunch parties, or any party, would be a great place to do some catering events, classy, not cheap, but not expensive either.   Yummy!	4
	1626	"Interior is nice. Charming patio. Menu is nothing really unique.  I was disappointed that they only had regular coffee, no Americano's, not even an Espresso machine which seems odd this day and age for a \""Cafe\"". For not looking to busy, service was pretty slow. The roast beef and pastrami sandwiches were good. Server was very nice, but seemed like they were having major issues with the cooks in back getting things done right and in timely manner. No water at tables and took ages for unripe tomatoes. What sandwich place doesn't have Dijon?"	1
	1627	I try with every ounce of my spirit to make it out to Del Frisco's whenever I'm in Vegas (and sometimes even subconsciously organize trips there for the sole reason of hitting it up) and my most recent visit last week did not cease to please me with the salty fatty goodness of a proper porterhouse seldom attainable in my hometown of SF. Most of the group went with the various filet mignon cuts offered (including a sampler special), and while I wasn't quite hungry enough to get the full double eagle (32oz), the classic porterhouse was done up just right, a red but not bloody medium, and delicious sides that are wholly unnecessary.\n\nLast time I was here was the first time I ate (and had room for) dessert -- we had the molten chocolate cake. Very decadent but not overdone, and served with a scoop of ice cream to play off the warm of the cake and provide light contrast visually and flavorfully. Nothing amazing compared to the steak, but nice to split if you are in the mood.\n\nNote: this place cooks their stake on the rare side, so usually it's a good idea to kick up your preferences by a point (i.e. get medium if you usually prefer medium-rare).	4
	1628	Hmm! Can this even be a real NY-style Jewish deli without any matzo ball soup? These are life's complicated questions. Anyway, I have not had any of their deli sandwiches yet, just their jumbo hot dog, which was just okay.	2
	1629	This place is decent.  We went to watch Thursday Night Football and they had great happy hour specials with $2 beers and half off a decent list of items including chicken wings, tri tip quesadilla and lobster quesadilla, chicken bbq pizza, tx chili, and many more items.  The lobster quesadilla was quite decent while the chili was awful but take this from a chili snob from TX.\n\nThe tv setup is not as good but if i lived in the area i may frequent b/c of proximity.\n\nIt's a decent spot.  I probably won't be back but if you go during happy hour they have decent deals.	2
	1630	All I really have to say is...\n\n\nTheir chocolate cake is SOOOOO good.\nTake it to go!\nEat it at home and have a glass of milk with it.	3
	1631	Tried the food twice and it was so good. The staff was very friendly and let me try a few different things before I made my decision. I will definitely go back... a lot.	4
	1632	"I have such mixed feelings about this place, it was the first club I ever went to and being into \""alternative music\"" was, and still is, one of the very few options I have in Edinburgh for a going out a for a dance and I have had some truly great nights out there.  It also hosts gigs, an being a big fan live music I often attend for that purpose.\n\nAs a club, its OK, Saturday night (the rock night) is when I tend to go and although I hardly go nowadays (compared to every week or two when I was younger) it seems to be the same songs every week  and has been the same for the last 10 years (it does feel like i go back in time every time I step in) and they do play some more modern stuff now, the same old same tunes are guaranteed to prevail.  It can be fun though,  and yes its dirty, and sweaty and the toilets stink and the floors stick, but to be honest that's what makes this place \""the studios\"" and its cheap enough.  If they tried to do the same thing is a clean, modern and shiny venue it would just fall flat on its arse.  Problem is, it seems to have got a bit elitist and judgemental and the last few times I have been there I have spent WAY too long trying to get a drink and getting blatantly ignored in favour of the regulars, to the point where even they had to tell bar staff that it was time to serve me.  This has happened to pretty much everyone i know that doesn't fit a stereotypical rock/punk/emo/metal look and just seems a bit crazy seeing as their numbers are in decline, you would think they would be encouraging custom, not pushing it away.  Problem is, with the likes of the Cathouse and Classic Grand in Glasgow showing how it should be done, its hard not to compare and end up with the conclusion that Studio 24 pales in comparison, especially as its so easy to just take the trip to Glasgow for a night out instead and get the night bus home.\n\nAs a gig venue though, it is one of the best small venues in Edinburgh.  Its a good size, with good sound and a great layout for viewing and wish there were more small bands that I like playing here rather than Glasgow.  The staff don't cause any grief when its a gig either, which is nice.\n\nIts an Edinburgh Institution, and i'll no doubt be back and i'll no doubt have fun, I will just never hold my hopes very high!"	1
	1633	You can't go wrong for a great casual Thai meal, and you can walk in!	3
	1634	I normally dont write reviews unless i'm VERY compelled.  This was one of those situations.  I am staying in a room and we have only been sitting for about 20 minutes when  we found old dried blood on the bed runner in  more than one spot. We called and asked if they could change the linens. They sent someone who looked at the stain and left. After about 20 minutes the front desk called  and asked us if we wanted linens changed or just to change rooms. My friend asked if we could have a discount or moved to a suite because of the gross inconvenience and they treated us as if we were the scum of the earth. She told us that whoever looked at the stain said that the blood looked fresh, as if we did if ourselves, and the most they would do is change the linens. 20 more minutes they sent two cleaning ladies  who stripped one bed (even though we asked them to change both beds) then they left. We have now been waiting 2   hours of our very precious vacation and we still dont even have linens. I will never stay here again. I prefer to feel appreciated when i give a business my money.	0
	1635	We tried to get breakfast one morning here, and missed all the quick takeout options (1115am is past their time).  We walked thru the District and remembered we had seen this place.  \n\nWe had the Fried Egg Sandwich - two fried eggs, on ciabatta with bacon and cheese (sorry, cannot recall).  \n\nIt was excellent!!	3
	1636	"I had a problem w mice so I called terminix (a name I recognized from TV). \n\nHere's what happened:\n\nCalled customer service (central location that books out to branches) and setup an appointment. Scheduled next day for a technician to show up during a several hour period (think cable guy business model). Took the morning off work... Waited... Waited... Waited. No one ever showed. Called customer service (on hold for 20 min while they called the branch ... Told me I cannot contact the branch myself because they are \""forbidden from giving out employee phone numbers\""... Whatever that means)  customer service then told me that the branch manager would be calling me shortly to get someone out. Proceeded to sit at my house for the rest of the day and never heard from the manager (Mitch?) who was supposed to call. Whole day wasted, never saw or heard back from anyone. \n\nCalled CS back and they told me someone would reach out in the next 24-48 hrs... No thanks. \n\nCouldn't tell you how they actually do when it comes to exterminating BUT I can tell you if you're looking for the \""we don't care AT ALL\"" about your business, business model - this is your place!"	1
	1637	Good beer, BUT bad, bad food. Had horrible poutine - which is sad considering that Wisconsin cheese curds should have been the bomb but instead were rubbery and tasteless. Tomato red pepper soup was inedible, salads were anemic. Everything else was microwaved and/or canned. Bills itself as a gastropub, but instead gave me gastroenteritis...	1
	1638	I was here a couple of times. Sometimes it's all packed up and you'd have to wait a long time to even get your take out...\nOverall the food is ok...I actually think it's improving. The first time I had pad tai and it was too sweet and too much sauce (the bad impression could also come from long waiting and food not so fresh after taking out and walking to schenley plaza to eat....) The last time I went there, I had a shrimp curry and it was pretty good.\nBy the way, the place is always kinda dark....	2
	1639	"We dined at Orange Sky last Saturday and the place was packed! The casino was full and so was the restaurant.\n\nWe had a party of 11 and were not so lucky to get a super long table from tip to tail. Use the potty before you sit down in the large comfy chairs because backing them up for a break can be interesting.\n\nThe service seemed great at first and then went progressively downhill. The servers should probably learn how to do magic tricks and make balloon animals to entertain the customers while they are waiting and waiting and waiting.\n\nThe restaurant was out of lobster for a 7PM seating and after 3 people ordered oysters they came back to say they were out of those as well.\n\nThe crab Louie salad had an odd flavor to the dressing and 3 unexplainable crustini's that you couldn't cut or pick up.\n\nTough and slow seemed to be the buzz words at the table. I had the pork chop and it was so dry I felt like I could blow dust out of my mouth while trying to muster up enough saliva to swallow it.\n\nEveryone that ordered steak said they were tough and overdone. The beef comes from Arkansas.\n\nThe asparagus was the size of my big toe and was recommended over the brocolini.\n\nThey graced our birthday boy and girl with a fabulous chocolate mousse desert which was very good. As we all stared and shared they came back 10 minutes later to see if anyone else wanted desert, but the chocolate mousse was not an option.\n\nWhen the one dreaded desert order was taken I ordered a hot tea which had at least a half of a cup of tea leaves in a two cup pitcher. Can you say, \""tea buzzzz\""?\n\nMaybe they need to read some of these reviews as these seem to be common complaints.\n\nThe venue is very very nice and I think you know what I think about the rest."	1
	1640	"It's the best Mexican delivery in Scottsdale if you have enough of their hot sauce BUT apparently their hot sauce is so precious you can't get more with deliveries no matter how clear you make it. I order at least once a week and EVERY SINGLE TIME I tell them I need extra hot sauce. They so ok and I say, \"" PLEASE I need extra hot sauce. You guys always forget so please put 2 in, I will pay for it if I need to\"". The nice lady on the phone says \""okay, okay we have it\"". I'll say, \""are you sure, I need extra. Not one but 2.\"" She says \""yes, yes we have that\"". Guess what happens AT LEAST half of the time.....no extra hot sauce. I mean when I get my order I look around for Ashton Kutcher to see if I am being punked, tonight after asking for extra and clarifying at least 3 times not only was my ONE hot sauce container half full but so was the guac and sour cream. El Molina, I hope you read this.....PLEASE listen to people when they call and place an order. You never have a problem getting the credit card # right but for some reason you hate giving extra hot sauce. I mean, charge more if you need to, tell people you only make a certain amount each day or just tell people I don't give a crap about you and you aren't getting hot sauce....do whatever but just don't always say \""ok, ok, yes, yes sure hot sauce\"" and then not give and extra. COME ON ALREADY, it gets so old!"	2
	1641	Everything on this menu might be under $10, but $2.49 for a refillable soda/tea?  WTF...that is a ripoff.  Come on in and pay more for a drink than you do for a soup or salad.  What a crying shame.  Shame on you Fiesta Henderson....Shame Shame Shame...!!!  And since we had issues with our first round of Bloody Mary's, after the replacements were delivered and accepted, we felt rushed and expected to leave soon.  What a disappointment, especially since the food was AMAZING!!!!!	0
	1642	We love the Greek Island Grill! Great service and great food.	4
	1643	My daughter went here for a regular exam and check up. They took her card information for payment. They ran the card 3 times, but took the one payment. This incurred $6 worth of fees for the multiple attempts. They then took the money and continue to bill her. We have faxed over the proof of all the attempts and the actual debit. They still continue to bill! Pathetic! They need to get it together.  Why they had to swipe it 3 times when they had their money I have no idea!	1
	1644	The food here is edible but not much better than that.  I have gotten food delivered from here and have eaten in the restaurant and have never eaten the food and said man I gotta order that again.  The tacos use lettuce instead of cilantro which I am not a fan of.  There are far better places to get Mexican food in Madison.	0
	1645	I LOVE Panda Express! I especially love that this one is within a mile from my home! everything on the menu is delicious, and i never can decide what to get. Only downside of this location is the drive thru wait time. there's been times where there may only be two cars ahead of me, and the wait can still be anywhere from 8-10 mins.	3
	1646	"Pierre, with comments like that i have no choice LOL \n\nSwaddee is OK. See, there i did not say it sux or not worth it. You happy now? LOL ;)\n\nYeah, its alright. Been there bunch of times for lunch from work and once for dinner. Dinner was better. Lunch is fine. Do not believe their star rating, 5 will NOT burn your eyes out. \n\nNow, is it best Thai ever? Noup, it aint. Is it best in the neighborhood? MAYBE! However is you are willing to go a few miles West into Foothills you will find Thai Basil which i think quite a bit better. \n\nNow, there we have it. Efff me and my effing opinions :)\n\n\""Its awight\""\n\nEugene"	2
	1647	After seeing the reviews here on Yelp, I decided this was the restaurant the family would try this last Sat (5/31/08).  Sat night church, followed by dinner has become our family night.\n\nThe ordering system does take a little getting used to.  \n\nThe kids were a little concerned that there was no hot sauce and even suggested taking out to ensure they had some...the concern was a non-issue since there were some sauces by the soda fountain.\n\nThe kids loved the Cuban black beans.  I couldn't get past the look and texture.  Not sure why, it's not a texture any different than a refried bean, guess I just don't like to see it so dark.\n\nKids had the popular Jade Red Chicken and Carnitas quesadillas.  The hubbie and I stuck w/ bowls.  He had the Chinese BBQ Pork and I had the Chicken Diablo.  Both the hubbie and son didn't think the Diablo was too spicy, but I found that it is a cumulative hot that builds as you eat more; my mouth was on fire by the time I finished my meal.\n\nWe also got big snickerdoodle cookies with our meals.\n\nConsensus was the food was good and we will probably return.	2
	1648	L O V E this place!! Best ever and enjoyed every bite yummy!! I went with the pecan turtle, it was just for me so I went with the one scoop version. This yummy treat was worth it! Everyone was very nice and helpful. Of course I had to sample plenty but was able to find the one for me. Make sure to stop by because it's worth it!	4
	1649	Delicious omelettes and sandwiches. Croissants were excellent.  My daughter has celiac.  The staff was very accomodating. They had delicious brazilian cake that was gluten free.  They also had GF bread. Will definitely visit again.	4
	1650	"Our experience wasn't very good. Our food had a nice presentation, appeared to be of good quality, but was surprisingly bland in all 3 cases. I had the Beef Short Ribs. It was nice that they were very tender, but were lacking flavor. Others at our table had the Duck and BBQ Chicken, and surprisingly, we all agreed that everything was bland.  Another disappointment was the over-priced average wine.\nFor our experience, and what we were expecting (from another recommendation) it was certainly way over-priced and not worth it.\nThe worst part was the waiter we had - he seemed to try to rush us through our decisions and seemed slightly irritated when we asked questions. The manager on duty was nice and stopped by to check on us. All in all, I'm guessing we had one of those \""bad nights\"", and unfortunately, walked away without a reason to return.  For the dollar, there are many other restaurants we'd choose over this one."	1
	1651	"Maybe I went on an off day but I was not impressed with this pizza.\n\nBut before I get into that, I was also not impressed with the service. Our waiter was just kinda weird. And not in a good way. Every time he came to our table he would stand there and wait for us to speak first which I found rather strange and off putting. He was the employee, shouldn't he have led the conversation? He literally stood by our table until I said \""well, I think we're ready to order.\"" Weird. Whatever.\n\nThe boyfriend and I ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza. I was excited because I usually love hand-tossed brick oven pizza and I had read so many great reviews. Our pizza was lukewarm and the crust in the middle of the pizza was soggy. It was fine on the outer edges but what a way to start a slice - with a mouthful of soggy pizza goo. I thought it was pretty expensive as well.\n\nSo now all I think of when I think of Grimaldi's is a soggy pizza. Yuck. I don't think I'll be rushing back for more."	1
	1652	Good, but not exceptional. \n\nIf you like it spicy on a scale of 1-10, order an 11. \n\nI've been there a couple times and the pad thai and tom kha soup are the only note worthy dishes I have experienced. It is a bit pricey for the small portions. If it was an extraordinary dish I wouldn't mind the prices, unfortunately that's not the case.	2
	1653	Meh. 2 stars both for food and atmosphere. Not impressed-- sushi did not taste fresh and everything was just ok. Don't waste your money ('cause it's not cheap, either). Will most likely not be back.	1
	1654	Wow! This is a hidden gem. Excellent service, great selection. Our son and the wedding party rented their tuxedos from a well-known national company and they each paid over $140 for the tuxedo & the trimmings. \n\nLiving in Arizona, my retired husband does not have a need for formal cocktail attire. My son, the groom received a coupon from Dapper Dan's in the mail last week and gave it to my husband. \n\nWith one week to go before the wedding, we walked in the door with hopeful expectation that they could accommodate our short time frame. \n\nIn less than an hour, my husband was decked out in a beautiful business-suit type tuxedo with the vest, tie, shirt, shoes & slacks--the works for slightly over $80 including the tax. And that was the upgrade. They have a wonderful package for young men going to the prom or special occasions--even weddings, for $50 +$10 to rent the shoes. \n\nThe staff was friendly & knowledgeable. They have a large selection of different tuxedos, shirts. One of the owners, Sandra, said they have new styles arriving next week. \n\nI honestly doubt the big chain stores can beat the price. In these times where many people want to look great & are watching their budget, Dapper Dan's is the perfect spot. \n\nToo bad there isn't a place like this for the girls going to proms (or moms going to weddings!).	4
	1655	So I was out in the greater Phoenix area and stayed out here in SURPRISE! yeah I think its always a Surprise in Surprise haha... but my buddy needed to pick up some cash and deposit a check before we went to the USC vs ASU game. So what were we to do but head over to the bank.\n\nWell surprise surprise... Arizona still has drive up tellers... That kicks azz! I miss these in California. None the less they also have an ATM island to conduct your bidness at afterhours or if the drive thru is busy.\n\nPro Tip: Drive thru, walk in, or ATMs who could ask for more?\n\nWell we had a quick n easy trip to this branch. Friendly, lots of AC inside I would imagine (we didn't go in), easy to navigate drive through lanes. What more do you need?\n\nHow about a quick n easy transaction and we were in and out and didn't have to leave the car. Talk about nice and wonderfully easy. Great quickie trip to the bank. I wish that we had the drive through tellers in California still...	3
	1656	"NO \""Show us your papers please\"" B.S. at the checkout. And nice prices. \n\nExample: \n\nCan of beans at the Albertson's next door: $1.69, but only $1 if you sign over your privacy, etc. Same can of beans at F&E: 99 cents, no card to sign up for, no coupon, just buy it.   In my book that's a win. \n\nI hate the frigging separate key-chain full of bar-codes I'm forced to carry to get \""Deals\"" anywhere I go anymore. \n\nNow, beyond that rant, this place is great for high entertainment. When you go in the morning there's this guy working, who got to be pushing idk 55 or so and he wears over sized short-short jogging shorts, and he never greats you with \""Hello,\"" or, \""Good morning.\"" He will look you dead in the eye, and almost sternly (but not offensively) ask, \""Are you alright?\"" Like you've just hit your head or something. I'm not sure he even know he does it but it's hilarious, and I have to bite my tongue from laughing. Also I've mentally nicknamed him YMCA because of these shorts. \n\nGood prices, clearly labeled organics, good quality store-brand generics (the kids don't even complain about them!) and a little jogging shorts show. What more could you want from a grocer? \n\nBONUS: The aisles are not clogged with patio furniture for sale, bicycles, over sized teddy bears, etc."	2
	1657	"There's not that many true Taiwanese restaurants in Vegas, which is a shame because I really do enjoy my beef rolls, pork chop rice, and beef noodle soup. My parents heard about this place through the Chinese newspaper and suggested we try the place out. Coincidentally, Taiwan Kitchen is several doors down from the other Taiwanese place I go to- Yi Mei Champion Deli. \n\nWhen we walked in, we were greeted by the waitress and promptly seated. Besides us, there was only one other customer eating, which I attributed to us being there right at the start of the lunch hour. We ordered the Taiwanese Beef Lo Mein, Pork Chop Rice, and Spicy Beef Noodle Soup. The first two dishes arrived fairly quickly, and then 2 other parties arrived. All the other parties' dishes started to arrive, and that's when I started to realize that they had forgotten about my noodle soup. My mother asked the waitress where our soup was and why the other tables were getting their orders even though they came way later than us, and immediately the waitress' face was like \""OH CRAP\"" and she quickly apologized. Needless to say our soup came right after that. Other than that little mishap, service was good.\n\nTaiwanese Beef Lo Mein- tastes like any other fried noodle dish you can get at your neighborhood Chinese takeout place, skip it. \n\nPork Chop Rice- came with a boiled egg, sliced daikons and carrots, and pickled radishes. Usually, the pork chop is suppose to be marinated and then fried to a crispy, but this pork chop was covered in some sweet sauce? My mom said it tasted like teriyaki sauce so that could've been it. My father, who is Taiwanese, and knows a lot about the cuisine, was not pleased. \n\nSpicy Beef Noodle Soup- came in a huge bowl, can easily feed 2 people. The noodles and meat were good, but the soup was not at all spicy, which was disappointing. When I eat beef noodle soup, drinking the soup is one of the best parts and if it's not spicy enough to get me sweating and panting, then the chef has not done his/her job. \n\nOverall, the service was good, prices are decent, but the food could've been better. I also noticed that they were missing a lot of the traditional Taiwanese appetizers like beef rolls, oyster pancake, pig's ear, etc. They do serve many varieties of boba drinks, but I didn't get to try. I suppose that I will have to go back to Yi Mei next time I want to get my SPICY beef noodle soup fix."	1
	1658	If you decide to eat here, definitely come during happy hour for their great deals.  We ordered items from both the regular and happy hour menu. We started with the usual edamame which were a little overdone, but tasty.   The highlight of the night was the saut\u00e9 roll and lobster salad roll.  The spicy tuna roll and Philly roll were mediocre at best.  On to the main courses:\n1) Salt and pepper cod tempura style - Tempura batter is supposed to be light and crispy, but this dish was nothing like that. You would think that since the dish has the word salt in it's name, it would not lack on the seasoning- also not the case. Because it was so bland, I had to ask the waitress to bring a side of tempura sauce for me to dip the fish in to make it edible.\n2) miso sea bass:  to do miso marinated fish properly, you have to marinate it for at least a couple of days. This tasted like the fish was just broiled and brushed with some sauce that tasted off somehow (not enough miso maybe?)  \n3) kung pao chicken: this was spicy with bold flavors, but had a very americanized taste to it.  I think it would've tasted better if they didn't call it kung pao.  \n4) fried rice: this was pretty good. The rice was al dente, and seasoned well, but also had an Americanized taste to it.\n5) rice pudding: this was tasty, but a little on the dry side. I think it had coconut milk in it which gave the good flavor.  My advice is to save your appetite and money for another establishment.	1
	1659	Online ordering and delivery is always awesome, especially for those days you just don't feel like going out. Their delivery is prompt and the food arrives piping hot and relatively tasty. The prices are event reasonable.\nThe problem? I think the food is totally laden with MSG. That'll be the last time I eat food from here. I had just a few bites of food and a few hours later I realize that I've drank about 40oz of water and my tongue still feels dry, and I've got the headache from hell.\nTo be fair MSG affects everybody differently and I'm pretty sensitive to it. Order at your own risk. Their egg rolls are pretty good.	1
	1660	3 years ago Phoenix Cake Company made our wedding cake.  It was beautiful and delish!  They were able to do a smooth buttercream cake without fondant, which a few years back seemed to be a lost art.   The cake was so good, we didn't have hardly any left over - and my hubby often laments that he doesn't even remember what our cake tasted like!  \n\nSince then they have opened up a retail shop, with cakes, cupcakes and chocolates ready made.   We happened to drive by the other day and stopped in for a cupcake or 2 :)   They were all delish!  We ended up trying 6 flavors...   The cake was moist and flavorful, the frosting just right sweetness and not greasy.  Yum Yum Yum.   So stop by and treat yourself to a cupcake or get one of their specialty cakes for your next event!  You won't regret it!	4
	1661	If you need a MANABLOC MANIFOLD THIS IS THE PLACE to have replace it. Our house was built in 1995. Apparently they used something called a MANIFOLD when building the plumbing. (all the plumbing hoses go to one location, the MANIFOLD). ours leaked horribly and we needed a replacement. All the plumbing companies I called suggested JENNI PLUMBER. They were able to order us a manifold thru photos we sent. Chris did the repair. He did a great job. Everyone on staff at the Cheyenne location was very nice.  I RECOMMEND Jenni Plumber!	4
	1662	I've been waiting to try Kickstand for a while considering my love for a good burger. There's some positive and negative reviews based on food and/or # of TV's, etc. It's a sports bar in Plaza Midwood, so it gets a knock against it by many for that. For me, variety is great. \n\nWhen we got there we sat in one of the booths. Now I love a good sports bar and this one has a neighborhood feel to it. Granted the TV's in the booths are a little much, but all the other TV's are just fine and make for a great game day! Had a great lunch special that day for $6.95 which included a burger, side and drink. Ordered the bacon cheeseburger medium with the onion straws as a side. Came with onion, tomato & lettuce w/pickle. \n\nThe meal for me was OK. It was a good burger, though a tad overcooked. That said; it had good flavor and was a great size for the price, special price or not. The let down were the onion straws though. They were soaked in oil/grease as if they hadn't been cooked long enough. I was able to dive into some of the wife's tater tots and they were good. I'd go with the tots next time for sure. Good experience and I'd return for another meal for sure.	2
	1663	Great place, perfect stress relief mantra.\n\nThe masseurs are very professional and the place is very quiet.\n\nDefinitely recommend if you are looking for a good massage. \n\nPrice is also very reasonable. Definitely going back.	3
	1664	"I am writing this review specifically because my therapist Kara was so awesome.  I've had a lot of massage and this was one of the best ever.   I tried this place from their Groupon.  The receptionist was pretty \""meh\"" but the massage was great."	3
	1665	[I'm a local]\n\nWe got there RIGHT before the dinner rush, which was awesome. Otherwise I think we would of waited over an hour.\n\nSeafood - good\nPizza/Pasta - meh\nEgg flower soup - no (smelled over cooked)\nHam - good\nOverall vegetables - good\nChow mein - no\nSushi - no\negg-rolls - no (I didn't get any but I saw a lot get put to the side)\nDeserts - Good (Make your own sundae...)\nSalad bar - good\nNoodles - no (they were dry and/or sticky)\n\nEverything else was average, so it's pretty much like every other buffet. It does have a much larger variety of food than most others.\nThe service was good, our plates got picked up efficiently, and napkins were readily available..	2
	1666	Food was disappointing. Hash browns were pre-formed, like the kind you get from McDonalds. I don't understand how this place has such high marks. Maybe it's gone downhill recently. I don't recommend.	1
	1667	"My stylist was a girl with poofy pink hair and an undercut. I told her I wanted my shaggy hair cut short, but not so short as to show scalp. She set the clippers to number 6 and trimmed the back and sides. After a quick wash, she took scissors to the top and left it several inches longer than the rest of the hair. At the time I thought it looked okay, if not quite what I had asked for, so I deemed it good enough. However, after going home and getting a better look at it, I realized that it was very uneven.\n\nSo, for the same price I had paid for one visit to this mall salon, I bought a pair of clippers at the store, and asked my wife to even things out. Now, I'm not sure if this was the absolute first time she'd ever cut hair, but it was definitely the first time she'd ever used clippers. The result? A haircut that was actually even. It looked way better than what the so-called \""professional\"" at Mia & Maxx had done.\n\nIf you need a simple, short cut, you'd be better off investing in a good pair of clippers than going to Mia & Maxx. And since they couldn't even do a competent job of something that basic, I wouldn't even consider them for anything more complicated."	0
	1668	I've stayed at the Vdara twice & both times did not disappoint.  I love staying here for its modern appeal inside the rooms.  Had great views both times & had a speedy check-in.  The second time I stayed here, it was for a 1 nighter & it was perfect b/c I was going out to Marquee at The Cosmo to see Sander Van Doorn.  It was only a quick hop, skip, & jump away.  \n\nBeds = Amazing\nBathroom = Sleek & Modern\nKitchenette & Dining Table = Handy\nElevators = Fast & Pretty\nComplimentary Valet Service = Very Nice  \nPool = Relaxing Getaway \n\nVdara is def one of my top hotels to stay at while in Vegas.  Having no casino on the main floor is fine w/ me - being as I don't have the urge to gamble a lot.  Plus, you're in the city center... you aren't that far from any other hotel where you can gamble & just walk around the strip.  \n\nMight I add... the Crystals is beautiful.  (Especially at night)  :]	3
	1669	Nice ambiance, dinner menu pricey, staff was friendly, not the best Thai but decent for the Scottsdale lack of ethnic food.	3
	1670	We were the only ones in the restaurant at noon. When we left after 1 PM, two other tables of two were eating. Staff was friendly but not attentive. One girl was at a back table in the dinning room on a lab top, the other was polishing silverware. Our food was under seasoned and the plating was nil. Service was very slow especially for not having other patrons to serve. Our appetizer plates were left on the table until our main course was served.  Food took a long time to get to us. Water wasn't refilled either. We ordered the veggie burger the bun wasn't soft, way over toasted and no flavor in the burger.  The humus plate had a  four slices of cucumber rounds on it and a few packaged baby carrots.  We had to ask for salt and pepper and hot sauce to get some flavor out of it.  The quinoa salad served with burger was ice cold, and gummy. The super salmon salad was  some salmon spread on a flat muffin.  Again concept was good, but taste and plating was no where to be found.  What a shame.  Once our check came our server didn't come back to pick it up. Finally the young lady on the lap top came over and collected the bill. The chef in the back was a young man wearing earphone, really!  You can see into the kitchen.  There was a pile of dirty dishes on the ledge into the kitchen, not a pretty sight from the dinning room.  Must of been left over from the night before.  They have a good concept but no direction and it appears a great lack of concern for the business. They need to step it up.  It seems like with the lack of management, attentiveness and patrons it's not going to last long. Someone needs to care more about the food and service.  Location is nice and menu had some nice choices, but nothing was executed well. Tables outside were not set up for service and it was a lovely day, too bad. Again, where is the owner or manager?	1
	1671	Try the Shanghai dumplings, lettuce wrap,  Chilean seabass, tofu with eggplant,  Hakka noodles, asparagus, and macarons!  Delish!  Server's and bartenders know their stuff here and it has an awesome romantic vibe.	4
	1672	Food taste and quality are good but the price is high for the quantity of food they serve.	2
	1673	I joined Massage Envy during my second pregnancy because I experienced severe pain in my lower back and hips (sometimes I couldn't walk). After trying a few different therapists, I got Tim. He is awesome! He gives the best massages, and has been the only therapist to alleviate the pain in my lower back and hips. If you want a massage, go to Tim!\nThe front desk staff is always friendly and polite, and the rooms are always clean and relaxing. If you have chronic problems with muscle tension, Massage Envy is well worth the commitment.	4
	1674	Had a little day date with my boyfriend. I got The Quiche of The Day (spinach, mushroom & Chicken) which was AMAZING!!! Came with a side salad. My boyfriend had the Honey Pecan Chicken with broccoli casserole and mash potatoes. Everything was wonderful. Looking forward to going back here soon	4
	1675	Appeal:\nOpen 24/7\nWalkable distance from work\nFriendly staff\n\nI know, there should be more than that on the appeals side, since this is a place that serves food. I've been here on two occasions: one was a pickup for lunch, and the other was a going out to lunch. Both times, the prices were reasonable, and the staff was friendly and attentive. Food... not so impressive.\n\nFor my to-go order, I got a BLT with fries. I like a lot of veggies on my sandwiches more than the average person, but there were huge hunks of shredded lettuce on this sandwich. I had to take half of it off. There was barely any mayo, and what there was of it was scraped thinly across very, very dry wheat bread. Nor was it cut, which might seem like a moot point, but this thing was stuffed to the gills with lettuce, and would have been easier to eat. The fries were average.\n\nMy dining-in order was when I went with some co-workers for lunch. I decided to go with the Greek salad. I know, not your typical diner choice, but if you're going to put something on a menu, make sure you can make it well. \nThe salad was so soaked with dressing that towards the end I couldn't even finish it because everything was so saturated. Mostly lettuce and black olives (which are not good on a Greek salad, though they might someday find that Greek olives are), and a small smattering of bland feta. The high point was that it was served with some kind of weird sugary bread with cheese melted on it that was actually very tasty, but sadly, the best part of the meal.\nMy co-workers almost all go burgers, saying that they were excited to try the diner's hand-cut french fries. When I had had the fries with my BLT, they had just tasted like regular fries, nothing crazy special. \nAll of their burgers are cooked to medium-well, so I'm assuming that they come frozen. Another collegue got the fried fish lunch, but didn't feel well after.\nMost hilarious of all was the drink situation. It didn't really effect me since I got water, but everyone else except one person got sodas. First and up to the third time around, they were still all flat. Each time they brought new drinks, they said that the Co2 had been fixed, but it ended up never being fixed and they all ended up getting sweet teas instead. \n\nAll in all... definitely have had better at diners elsewhere. No doubt people will want to go back for lunch again and I'll trudge along, so keep posted for a hopefully more positive review next time around. \n\nOn a saving note, everyone that I've talked to says that they have really good breakfast food. Maybe I'll try that avenue next time.	1
	1676	Definitely a great value. Food quality is great. As good as some of my best experiences with sushi. Tuna firm and flavorful. Soft shell crab fantastic and rustic in presentation. All rolls expertly prepared and super quick. \n\nFriendly and attentive staff. \n\nThis was a really fun time with great food. \n\nThank you Masa for a great experience.	4
	1677	Oh man there was so much food! And mirrors! and indoor trees!\n\nGreat place for a little hair of the dog. Tasty bloody mary, as many have pointed out.\n\nAnd the decor is awesome.\n\nShort wait for 5 at 11am, prime time when everyone was waking up from the night before. \n\nHUGE portions. I ordered french toast and a side of bacon, and it was a TON of texas toast. Lots of syrup. Everything was satisfying.\n\nSlay your hangover here!	3
	1678	Visited Root twice in the last few months. The first time our experience was fantastic, it was not crowded or loud but had a great ambiance. The highlight of the experience was actually our server, who we chatted with for an hour about beer and our love of food and places we've been. The food was also fantastic and we really enjoyed their wine list.\n\nThe second time was more of a two-three star experience. The food was decent. The first trip we had brussels sprouts that were excellent, while the second time they were burnt pretty badly. The rest of the meal went fine, but our server this time around was rather off his game and did only came and asked how we were, took our order and brought our check. He seemed, honestly, seriously stoned. So, for us, it was hit or miss on the two times we went. But it is definitely a highlight in a great neighborhood.	3
	1679	Food was plentiful but mediocre. BBQ Beef was the best thing we had. I didn't like the macaroni salad at all, but to be honest I usually don't care for it unless it's from Aloha cafe. Atmosphere- well there isn't much to speak of, but the lady behind the counter was very nice! If your in the area not a bad place to stop for an inexpensive lunch.	2
	1680	Great place for most of your oriental-cooking needs. They have a wide range of stuff, from Vietnamese rice noodles and paper to Thai curry pastes and coconut milk, as well as a large freezer filled with the ubiquitous frozen dumpling selection. Decent selection of steamers and other cooking utensils, as well. I had hoped they'd have a larger, better kept selection of exotic produce, since I stopped here on a half-day-long bean sprout hunt, but no dice. Mostly some wilted-looking bok choy and er...aged tofu. Ah well.\n\nThe lady behind the register is a sweetheart, and she's the only staff I've seen, so I can't really attest to everyone being as awesome as her. I come here when I've got a batch of Pad Thai or a curry planned, and will continue to.	2
	1681	I gotta be honest, I find Offbeat a little..... offbeat. \n\nOccasionally, they have a cute dress or two in the window. Inside however, I never seem to spot anything I like. The jeans, tees and hoodies all look dated and studenty whilst the sparkly tunic tops, dresses and leggings all look like garments designed for work functions and hen parties. \n\nLike I said, offbeat.	1
	1682	We tried The Spot for lunch, and it was just eh. At the end of the meal, it reminded me more of like a short-order restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the Spot sandwich (a plain chicken sandwich with mediocre quality bun), and a chicken salad. The best part of the salad was the little piece of apple cinnamon bread that came on the side. Otherwise, it was little more than salad with deli turkey/ham in it, and some walnuts. \n\nThe seating was uncomfortable, and there's only 2 tables inside downstairs, and 1-ish up the stairs. Not great for summer eating in AZ. We ended up outside. The misters helped a little, but it was disappointing that most of their seating is outdoors.\n\nThe dessert case looked pretty good, but not good enough to make me want to try it. \n\nI doubt we'll go back, it wasn't even compelling enough for me to write this review on the same day we went.	1
	1683	While Benecol is clinically proven to lower your cholesterol, this place is clinically proven to raise it. I guarantee you'll enjoy eating at this place, but make sure you've sent off to China for your donor heart before hand, cuz you'll be needing a new one.\n\nOn my one and only visit I got a deep fried pizza which I chewed on in the company of two JF's. They, being PHD students, probably viewed me with utter contempt, and were only there with me to conduct a study into socially inept and underdeveloped human beings. As a result I ate with a reasonable degree of dignity in an effort not to draw too much attention to myself.\nHad I been dining alone, my behaviour would have been distinctly less muted, and I would have wrung the doughy treat out into my mouth like a tea towel saturated with pizza flavoured fat. Then with more enthusiasm than a Romanian prostitute who had just realised she could earn a Leu and get something warm in her belly at the same time, I would have sucked the oily dregs from its limp remains, and given thanks for the privilege.\n\nYUM-YUM.	3
	1684	I actually liked it quite a bit.  I had the chicken crunch for appetizer (only 4 pieces, not really worth $10) and a full rack of ribs for entree.  It was HUGE.  I ended up forcing down the entire thing because I was going to a show after and I didn't want to carry around a doggy bag.  I wish there was an option for only a half rack...  Just expect to either share or take home half.  Fries were good, too.  And there's tons of specialty drinks named after movies if you're into that sort of thing.	3
	1685	Jewel's  makes delicious gluten free breakfasts and perhaps the best gluten free cupcakes I have ever tasted. They are by far better than some cupcakes with gluten in them. And not so sugary like some other gluten free cupcakes I have had. In a word they are perfection. I recommend the Almond Joy one. \n\nThe breakfast biscuits are also delicious. \n\nSo happy this place opened and takes gluten free seriously and deliciously!	4
	1686	Good Food cozy room but not what you would expect from such a high rated experience. Communication between the staff regarding bar drinks and wine was intolerably slow almost 25 minutes and the wine was great but the service aspect was amateur with this part of the evening. The food was wonderful very well described very heavy an after the 16th course I felt gluttonous but very well worth the eating experience at least once. We dined on a Saturday night at 9pm	3
	1687	I go to Fashion Square at least 3 times a month shopping for cosmetics. I wear Estee Lauder products. I went to Dillard's to test a new product I saw in a magazine. I stepped up to the counter & it took me a least 10mins before an associate even acknowledge my existence. The sad thing was they were just standing around talking. Now I may not look like a million dollars but I do have money. One of the associates finally walked over to see what I needed help with. I let her know I saw something in a magazine & wanted to take a little sample since I have very sensitive skin. She told me they could not give out samples!!! I don't understand?!? If I sample a product and I like it I will return to buy it, and if you give me good customer service & treat me with respect I will purchase the product from you. Isn't that how you are suppose to sell your cosmetics. When the associate told me that i looked at her & told her never mind I will go to Nordstrom and I walked off. I walked to Nordstrom and I was acknowledged as soon as I walked to the Estee Lauder dept with a smile. I eft the store with a new bottle of moisturizer which cost $98.00 & a sample of what I was looking for. I enjoyed the sample a week later I went back to Nordstrom and purchased the product. I will never make another purchase at the cosmetic dept in Dillard's. They are rude, obnoxious & arrogant. I should have know better....I have always enjoyed the great customer service Nordstrom has but I decided to give Dillard's a chance. They blew it!!	0
	1688	One word - Disappointing.\n\n I decided to take my husband here for his birthday and because they were also participating in restaurant week. Also, they have great happy hour specials on Thursdays. Perfect. \n\nFirst, I had requested on my reservation to seat us in a great seat with a view since it was a special occasion. They sat us in the back of the restaurant. Next, I ask for the happy hour menu and our waiter says happy hour is only in the lounge. So we couldn't get any drink specials which was annoying. Then we were brought out some crusty old stale rolls that were cold and hard and I immediately sent them back and requested fresh ones. \n\nI ordered from the restaurant week menu and my meal was great. It is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. My first course, the shrimp was a little overdone but had good flavor. 2nd course, my steak was cooked well. 3rd course, cake topped with mango and the basil ice cream was delicious.\n\nMy meal was not the problem. My husband ordered a veal porterhouse which came out looking like a big pork chop. Upon inquiring to the waiter, he told us veal turns white when cooked...what?! That is just flat out not true. I think our waiter was new on the floor because he was not knowledgeable about the menu (or steak in general) and just was b.s.ing his way through all night. \n\nI didn't like any of the steak sauces. Too bitter or too sweet. \n\nTo top off the evening, our waiter took FOREVER to bring us the check.\n\nI'm usually not a nitpicky person but when I'm spending $120+ on dinner, it better be well executed, delicious, with great service.\n\nThere are plenty of other spots in the valley to get a GREAT meal at that price point. Will not be returning.	1
	1689	I didn't really set any expectations for this place because I have never been to anything like this.  It was a fun experience.  The 3D movie at the beginning was really interesting.  The atrium was very humid, there are butterflies EVERYWHERE! I felt a bit intimidated as I was in their environment.  I was wary when walking because many of them land on the floor.  It's quite difficult to capture them as they fly around.. resulting in photos of flying black dots.  Its a great place to take kids.  As for the pricey entrance.. we would not come back unless we someone out of state were to visit.	2
	1690	Sweet little local bar on Trop & Pecos. Full bar. Decent prices. Karaoke is fun here. They have a couple of pool tables. Lots of TV's, all on sports! We dig it!!!	3
	1691	The only thing at TI worth seeing is the Sirens show out front. This buffet was boring, lacked variety, and the food was of questionable freshness. I know it is a Vegas buffet and not to expect much but I thought it would be better for the price. Now I know why they do not let you see the buffet until you pay. If I had the chance we would have gone elsewhere. The pork ribs were way undercooked, I addressed it and got a guy in a cheap sportcoat to tell me that is how they cook it. They cleared out table twice while we were getting something else. The desserts were offered a bit of redemption, but by the end of the meal , we were just ready to go. For a Strip Casino, this was a poor example.	0
	1692	Good food and great service!  My friend and I both enjoyed our meals.  The atmosphere is nice, especially if you sit out on the patio during the summer.  It's a great place to people watch while sipping margaritas. The waitress and owner were both friendly and I would definitely go back.	3
	1693	Diablo's was just outside Monte Carlo where I stayed in Vegas for my birthday. It was a nice place, service was a bit slow coz of having a lot of people for the weekend. Food was okay. I'm not really a fan of very noisy places when eating dinner, but hey... it's Vegas. Everybody seemed to be noisy all the time. Just let it stay in Vegas. LOL	2
	1694	Is there something I am not seeing in this place? Went there this evening with my dad not knowing that that it changed from chuys. Was not impressed at all. Sat down at a high top and a nice gentleman came up to us to explain everything but unfortunately could not understand a word he said except to deduct that we were to go to the bar to order. Place looked clean enough. Got the food, cheese enchiladas they were ok but nothing to write home about. Not a whole lot of flavor and did not realize it is served on styrophome plates and plastic utensils. Not my kind of place, and I am not too fussy on where I eat, if I want a lower rate Mexican place I would rather go to Carolina's right down the way.	0
	1695	I heard so many great reviews about this restaurant from friends so I need to go.  My family and I went to a late breakfast on Monday morning.  The place was full.  My mom and I split the sun-dried tomato scramble and my dad got eggs and bacon.  The food was average. The potatoes were plain and had very little flavor.  \nThe problem with this place was the service.  We saw our server a total of 4 times.  Once to take the drink order, food order, check on us after we were almost done, and to present the bill.  Our water glasses were empty the whole meal.  It wasn't till the end my mom had to flag someone else down to refill them.  I had only one cup of coffee since no one ever refilled it.  Our server passed are table several times without even checking on us.  Several times, we saw him chatting away with his coworkers in front of us.  He spent more time talking to them than to us.   \nThis was not worth the drive or the money.  I know much better places to go to for breakfast.	1
	1696	Absolutely love this place!! Got my nipples pierced I think by Robert and he was great very quick, very professional, very clean. Little to no pain. Can't wait to come back to get my tattoos! Pretty good price for tats and piercings, definitely check it out. Also not that it matters but the inside looks awesome!	4
	1697	Just got the start of a tattoo from Matt Kuggs owner of the shop. I have had tattoos most of my adult life and I have never gotten more jealous stares since I had this one. Kugg's use of color and color blends are like no other tattoo artist around. Both Kuggs and Chris are very knowledgeable about art and what will look good on your body.	4
	1698	The rooms were very clean and cool when we walked in.\n\nThe staff was very helpful and gave us great directions to our room.\n\nThe big negative is the parking situation.  The hotel has no parking and you have to pay the garage behind the hotel to park.	3
	1699	"I have to agree that when I am having a really shitty day I head over to the Ranch Market with my dancing shoes and I dance my shitty day away. This place from the moment you walk in envelops you in warmth and happiness and the smell of delicious treats wafting through the air. The side I usually walk in is the bakery area with those delicious cakes covered in an orgy of candied fruit and vibrant frosting. They have a great array of pan dulce and Mexican cookies. There are times when I take something like 10 bucks with me and hit up the produce for some yumlicious fruit or the fun little refrigerator section around the \""Aguas Frescas\"" area and buy some arroz con leche or Mexican soda. Note: If you have not had a Mexican coke, you have to stop what you're doing this instant and get yourself one right now!!! Mexican soda makes my eyes water every time, both from tears of joy and the hard core carbonation. Get a Mexican coke with some carnitas and you are set! Hands down some of the best prices around! Also if you do plan on going and perhaps wanting to shop but just for a few items take your own bag or hand basket. I only need to shop for myself and now take my own little bag every time. I went recently to this particular Ranch Mart and was scouring the front end of the store for a hand basket and found nothing. After asking several and I mean several employees, someone came up to me and told me they had only one hand basket for the entire store. Turns out folks take their groceries home along with the basket. If you don't have much patience veering the aisles with grocery carts filled with babies and food, you're going to have a heck of a time. Check this place out for yourself. I mean, where else can you go and buy a personal serving of flan, a pan dulce, some chicken feet and botas all under one roof?"	4
	1700	We got a Groupon for this burger joint and and once  we went to pay they said they didn't take the Groupon unless it was printed out. We explained that it clearly said you show the app or print it out. They said they couldn't accept anything that wasn't printed out. The manager then came back and said now the 'Owner' said they would absolutely not accept it and that they weren't participating in the Groupon (they changed their story). \nThe groupon clearly said the Silverton location. They had their location taken off the Groupon site but non the less the way they handled it was very poor. They lost a customer.\nIn this case it was just plain horrible management. They did a VERY poor job in handling this. We purchased a groupon in good faith, we went to the location that was specifically on the groupon, and the owner was a jerk about it as if we did something wrong.	0
	1701	Absolutely great venue to see a show!  I attended a private party Thursday night with Edwin McCain as the performer and was so impressed.  The food was good, the space was really nice and intimate for a show and the staff seemed great!	3
	1702	"Let me start off by saying that I was at this bowling alley this past weekend, all day Saturday AND Sunday for my kid's bowling tournament. I must say, it was a hellish experience. \n\nI'll start on the outside and work my way in to the bowling alley. This alley is located at the corner of the busy intersection of 59th and Betheny Home Rd. It's in the Food City shopping center, so that should tell you exactly what kind of colorful people are roaming the parking lot. There is very little parking for the bowling alley. It's next to a strip mall with a cell phone and check cashing place. You might feel safer parking far away anyway. \n\nThere is a security guard located at the front entrance of the bowling alley, making sure you don't smuggle any contraband, AKA real food in. He will stare you down and make you feel guilty, even if you didn't do anything. Inside, there are about 30 lanes. The place is small and the decor is set at circa 1970. It's fairly dim inside. I would have thought that they would have enough chairs there, seeing as they were sponsoring a bowling tournament! But apparently, they didn't get the memo. You had to show up over an hour early just to find a place to rest your weary bones. On the second day, the \""chair police\"" tried to muscle me out of some chairs I was saving for my group. \n\nThe lanes are fairly oily, if that's what you like. Lane 5 isn't very reliable. I would avoid that lane if possible. The food was standard bowling alley fare; nachos, pretzels, burgers, fries, etc. They serve breakfast, so that's a plus; however you would do better to order lunch at breakfast time. Our orders on both days took 40+ minutes to get to us. \n\nThere is this creepy looking employee there, hereby known as the Trash Nazi. He paraded up and down the aisles in military form, taking your trash before it was actually trash. He glared at your unused napkins until you surrendered them to his eager, and waiting bucket. We gave him trash just to get him to go away for a while. \n\nThe food was a decent price, but not worth the wait. The second day, half my party went down to the Food City, ate there, and returned before my food arrived. \n\nOh, and before I forget, take a sweater! The keep it at a frosty 45 degrees in there. Maybe they got confused and thought is was an ice hockey tournament. Needless to say, there was a bowling alley full of cranky bowling tournament spectators, standing in the back, shivering because they got no heat, and no chairs. \n\nIf you have a choice, go somewhere else."	1
	1703	"I lowered my expectations ahead of time since I'd read the other yelp reviews, but Cafe Monte managed to outdo themselves with bad service AND bad food.\n\nOur server passed by us several times, and when after 10 minutes I asked pleasantly if my companion and I could please order some water and coffee, he literally rolled his eyes and walked away. Then he served the beverages with no utensils or napkins. \n\nI won't quibble with the uninspired menu -- it's Cafe Monte's choice to offer what they wish, and mine to patronize the place or not, based on looking over the menu in advance. \n\nBut the simple strawberry crepes were stone cold -- not room temp, not chilly, but obviously just plated straight from the fridge and served! (OK, in fairness, they may have been run from the freezer through the microwave on \""defrost.\"")\n\nThe filling was the same pasty, tan substance as the topping. I thought it might have been a flavored cream cheese but I discovered at first bite that it was neither flavored, cream, nor cheese. \n\nShould I have sent it back? If I had seen our server, or any server, I might have. Rather than ask my companion to wait while I attempted a reorder, I nibbled the few slices of strawberries, picked at the crepe itself, and chalked it up to another mediocre suburban restaurant outing. \n\nAu revoir, Cafe Monte."	0
	1704	It was my first time at a Hard Rock Cafe, and I was really excited! \nI went with a party of 12, we made reservations before hand and the staff was accommodating with that.\nWe ordered drinks, which ranged from lemondrops, margaritas, beer, wine, mojitos, you name it---and everyone was pleased with their drinks.\nI ordered the steak, which was delicious. \n\nEveryone is very attentive to our needs... I think it helped that the restaurant was relatively empty on a Wednesday evening... but then again, downtown Phoenix seems to be empty 24/7. \n\nIt was noted by one of my friends that this was the first Hard Rock Cafe where she could actually hear herself talk... Although the staff, service, food, and drinks were awesome, and I have nothing to complain about, the atmosphere is dull and boring. If you're looking for a fun time---don't come here.	2
	1705	Happily surprised!   The food was fast and fresh. The service was GREAT!   The owner knows quite a few people by name and greets them as they come in.  Everyone that works the counter is very nice, didn't expect this level of service.   We will be back!	3
	1706	About a year ago, I approached the dive shop that I had frequented for many years about wrapping up my PADI Master Scuba Diver certification.  I learned at that time that they had decided to give up their PADI affiliation, which I was sad to hear as I've been a PADI diver since I was 17.  So, the hunt started to find a new shop to complete my training.  I'm an engineer, so I tend to research things quite a bit.  Found many shops around the valley, and several that were more conveniently located for me, but decided on The Scuba Shop, because of their PADI 5-Star IDC level and their on-site indoor heated pool.  A year later... I'm very, very glad with my decision.  The facilities are great, as are the instructors.	4
	1707	Good Sushi at a fair price.	2
	1708	"PROS:\n\n- Stayed in the North Tower of the hotel with a view of the north side of the strip.  $40 on a Saturday.  Pretty good.\n\n- Near EVERYTHING we love in Vegas... very easy walking distance to everything.\n\n- Parking was somewhat close (had to go through Paris), but easy.\n\n- Room was renovated (we think?) and was more than adequate for our $40 one-night stay.\n\n- Bed was comfortable and linens were seemingly clean.\n\n- Bathroom was much larger than most \""standard\"" hotel rooms on the strip.  And clean with lots of towels.\n\n- Ballsy has one of my favorite casinos, and connected to Paris, which also has a great casino.\n\n- Express check-out made it a whole lot easier.\n\n- Widescreen TV (not HD), but still had all the channels we liked.\n\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- Check-in took FOREVER.\n\n- On the way to Hotel Registration, was stopped by a guy trying to sell us on a hotel package.... we had just arrived and I was flu-ish and the last thing we needed was to be held up by a guy trying to sell us a bad deal.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get get rid of this promotion... NO ONE WILL BUY IT!!!!\n\n- Concierge says no restaurants in the hotel are open after midnight.  So when we returned to our room at 1pm and needed something eat -- whatever, as long as it's close -- our only option was heading to Paris or somewhere across the street.  Trudge, trudge, trudge.  And the cold air from the cold night was sobering.  (Ballys -- Your Sea website says they're open until 2am, but yet they closed at midnight.  Pffft.)\n\n- Bottled water at the gift shop is $5.\n\n- Wi-Fi is $14.  Cellular service on the iPad sucked.\n\n\nAll in all, I'd probably book again, but will bring some snacks with me in the future."	2
	1709	Beautiful, just beautiful.\n\nI had the Louisiana Pasta and wife had the steak and shrimp with potatoes and Mac n cheese, all was amazing!	3
	1710	I would like to thank Joanne for taking such good care of my cat. I was nervous bringing him in as I know he can be difficult. He won't let me do anything at all him it comes to taking care of his coat or nails for that matter. When I arrived at 9:00 I asked Joanne if I could come to the room and watch and she said yes as long as it didn't interfere with the actual grooming. Joanne explained that sometimes with the owner there the cat can become less cooperative as the cat wants to be with Mommy not the groomer. I stood and watched as she shaved my cat. Her patience as the cat started to move around the table was second to none. My cat put his 2 front paws on her shoulder and she started to sing to him and pet him and soothe him. He responded so well to her I was totally amazed. I was a nervous wreck and they were both having a great time. Joanne has taken care of my other cats for years now. My daughter, daughter-in-law and cousins all bring their cats to her. There is no other place we would go at this point. I was so impressed I had to hug her before I left. Thank you, thank you, thank you!	4
	1711	This is a review for just the tea, not the food. The tea is excellent and there are tons of options. You can specify exactly the type of tea, level of sweetness, and type of pearls you want, and prices are reasonable. Perfect for a cold winter day.	4
	1712	Only had takeout that my friend would bring over, but never stopped in here.  Very chilly inside that night, not sure why the a/c was running so high, but when my friend finally showed up, the other dining area was blocked off with chairs and we couldn't sit there.  FF is like a Filipino Panda Express, where you point and choose.  The Laing (taro leaf, coconut milk, meat) was nicely done with a spicy kick.  Not sure what my other dish was, but it was a tasty combination of onions, pimentos, green olives, beef braised in a tomato-based sauce.  The requisite steamed rice was hot and fresh, the pancit passable.  Reason for two stars? If I hadn't been starving, I probably would have walked in and walked right back out. The place REALLY needs a good cleaning--people, just close for a day and freaking declutter and steam clean the whole place!!	1
	1713	I am a big fan of Mexican food and I love this place. The food and drinks are awesome! I normally get the carne asada tacos if we sit at the bar. If we sit at the table then I will usually get the Pink Tacos. I recently tried the lobster tacos and they were great as well. I freakin love this restaurant and the chips are so good. This is a hip little bar-restaurant for the young crowd. My only complaint is that they are not open 24 hours! This is the perfect place to eat after the club!	4
	1714	Place is ok, a little small but it's ok. Food was pretty good also. Pad Thai, yellow chicken curry and panaeng was good. They don't serve hot oil though. Dried chilli did the job! Lol. Def coming back next time. Thai iced tea was good. Loved it. It was pretty big too compared to other Asian place.	3
	1715	The place is really spacious and the folks are really nice.  Pizza is decent but it's not Mineo's	2
	1716	They helped me but not really. I was asking about my a/c unit and they kinda were confused or something. Or maybe I was either way i did not get the right answers or products.	1
	1717	Went to lunch here with some coworkers. The design of the place is a little awkward to me and the music was loud. The line got very long, which is expected around noon on a weekday. I got a bowl with rice, black beans, barbacoa, cheese, and sour cream on the side. Chipotle has its own outdoor patio seating, but we sat at this long table in the communal area shared with a few other restaurants. The area was shaded, which I appreciated. As for my food, they filled that bowl up! And it tasted just as it should.	2
	1718	We walked in and were seated quickly. That was nice.\n\nFood was good. Pricey, but good. The edamame and fried tempura were absolutely amazing for a small appetizer before our sushi.\n\nThe sushi menu doesn't really have too much of a variety.\n\nAnd the music was just so loud that I couldn't enjoy my company's conversation.	2
	1719	I must have missed something that the other 1157 reviews didn't. I personally don't enjoy waiting 30 minutes in a line for a drink, having nowhere to sit, stand, or even dance. The dance floor was so packed people couldn't barley move. I guess that's a good sign for the club owners, their business is a success. I just was disappointed; I had higher hopes for this place.\n\nThe music was good, and the outside area is awesome filled with tables you could rent out for the night. I guess I should have done that and I'm sure this review would be a five star. Why is that? You have a server bringing you drinks, a place to dance, sit or even stand if you want. =)	0
	1720	I typically prefer entrees that are not centered on a meat ingredient.  This is a great place to find many options to choose from.  I really enjoyed the babaganoush.  The mozarella and tomato bruschetta could use better slicing techniques so the tomatoes aren't slipping off the toast.\n\nThe service for us was slower that the turn 'em and burn 'em restaurants so don't go if you're in a rush.  Go when you can hang out and savor the food.	3
	1721	I have tried a few of the burgers and dogs here and loved every one. This is a former Boston Market location and is essentially set up the same way. Don't be in a hurry, this is not fast food.	3
	1722	Quite simply, the best mens's haircut in the valley.  This GEM of a barbershop is nestled into a strip mall behind a Circle K convenience store.  You would only know about this barbershop if you happened to pass by which is unlikely given how embedded they are into Sun City.  Anyways, pass this one up at your own expense!  \n\nThe haircuts are all $10 and less, and the barbers are old-time pros that know their stuff.  JJ is the owner, he is the gent working the #1 chair when you walk in.  He does a great cut for adult and child alike and my son always asks for Mr. JJ.  \n\nRobert is on the #2 chair, and he is a consumate professional barber.  He will send you out with a great haircut every time!\n\nGo to save a buck or two, and keep going back because they rock!	4
	1723	"Let me start by saying the food was delicious and cooked to our liking. However, the portions were very small. Don't come here if you are looking for the \""Hungryman\"" dinner. The service was where our family was greatly disappointed. We waited far too long to receive the next course (15+ minutes) and our waiter was no where to be found, never checking to see how we liked our dinner. My water glass set empty during half the meal until I snagged a busboy to fill it for me. I saw our waiter only once during the meal when he did a \""flyby\"" through his serving area, not making eye contact with any of his tables. We waited and waited to order an after dinner beverage and when it was finally brought to the table, our waiter tried to leave both glasses with the closest person rather than distribute them accordingly. Our waiter shall go nameless here as I do not wish to humiliate openly on the web, but something was not quite right with this guy! Not just his absence, but his actions, speech, facial expressions and demeanor. I think that this establishment needs to reevaluate its hiring/training standards."	1
	1724	"Literally the worst meal I have ever had at a \""restaurant\"". I saw they had a groupon deal and checked Yelp and decided to try it out. What a huge mistake. The Kahuna burger, my God, what an absolutely TERRIBLE burger. Pattys had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The swiss cheese was not even melted and there was a very large amount of mayo on the burger. Every time I took a bite the entire middle of the burger would slide out of the bun because it wasn't melted. Now on to my biggest complaint; the fries. Their menu says something along the lines of \""add Rumbi fries, chips, or a salad to any burger for $1.95\"". So I order and say I want fries, expecting Rumbi fries. I get plain old fries, like at McDonalds. The amount of salt on these fries was unbelievable honestly. So when the cashier/server brought out the food I said are these Rumbi fries, I thought that's what I was getting. She said, and I quote, \""You gotta tell me whatchu want. You said you wanted regular fries.\"" I just about lost it right there, but somehow decided to hold my tongue. First of all, for $1.95, the options are chips, Rumbi fries, or a salad. How in the world am I supposed to know that normal fries would be served when they aren't even an option? Had I been served the Rumbi fries I might not be so critical of the rest of the meal, but without them everything else was just so terrible. Yelp definitely led me astray and I seriously would not recommend this place to anyone. I am not even exaggerating, a Big Mac or Whopper have more flavor than the terrible Kahuna Burger. This place tries to pretend to be Hawaiian by using pineapples. but it is just a poor excuse for a restaurant. I would not eat here again even for free. I wouldn't eat here again if I was paid to."	0
	1725	Gotta say, good stuff. Yes indeed the jalape\u00f1o bacon poppers are insanely good. My first bite I thought good then I started thinking about the tastes in my mouth and are most if the appetizer plate. Must have. \n\nI tried the BBQ sandwich and it was delicious. Much smokier than typical eastern vinegar based. Loved it with cole slaw. (The creamy version not the BBQ slaw) yummy.\n\nI has to sample my tables choices as will and the Mac and Cheese is worthy of every 8 year old, the baked beans had a great twist with some tomatoes and a tiny bit of pork and the sweetness was perfect. The curly fries were Fab too.  Add to that a great selection if on tap beer, friendly staff? Quick service and I will be back. Nice job Smokehouse.	3
	1726	Spent some good holiday weekends at the old O'sheas so had to check this out. It's small with three bars. One long bar against the back wall, quick bar when you walk in from the outside and a patio bar. Live music fun, beer pong fun, gaming tables well..... Why even bother when THE QUAD is right next to it. They should take out at least half of those add more beer pong, maybe BAGS and DARTS.  Also there's an LP in a shiny green suit walking around. Idon't know if he's employed by them but he was cool guy.	2
	1727	We just came here for the first time for my birthday dinner. It was a very quiet Sunday night. Not a lot of people dining, which was nice because we had great service and the food came out quickly. \n\nWe brought my son who is s toddler and they were very welcoming of him. A lot of times nicer restaurants make you feel bad when bringing in a kid. They did not. \n\nThe wine menu is HUGE! It can probably be a bit overwhelming if you are not a wine enthusiast. But the wait staff seemed very knowledgable about their menu. \n\nOverall, we would definitely go back, but only if someone was visiting and staying on the strip. The location is not the best for a local Summerlin family. But we are glad we tried it out!	4
	1728	All in all, I give this place 3.5\n\nThe food wasn't that great. My husband didn't enjoy his turkey burger, and most of our stuff was served at room temperature or cold. There were a few tables when we initially were seated, so I can give them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThe server we had was amazing, though. Very personable, warm, friendly, and attentive without being annoying or hovering. \n\nWe'll go back and try again, for sure. It's a dive, so I didn't expect a lot. We had a LOT of food between 4 of us, though, and it was less than $60.	2
	1729	I had the croque madame and it didn't really impress me. I was slightly disappointed. It tasted like a glorified ham sandwich. Maybe we came on an off day but I had high expectations. It was still tasty but it could have been better. And the fries were alright (I heard good things about the fries--even Anthony Bourdain raved about them on one of his shows). I'll be trying the one in Napa so hopefully I will have a better experience there.	2
	1730	Every time we passed this place there was always a line, which could be a good thing. In Vegas, we always make time for the buffet because we're gluttons and love a little bit of everything. Why order one breakfast item when you can have 20?\n\nThe hotel gave us a coupon book for different activities and restauants. There was a coupon f or $5.00 off per person for the buffet so we decided we had to go for breakfast, despite the line. While in line, I pulled up their Yelp review. Reviews were mixed, most good, some bad. We just went for it and boy was it worth it.\n\nWith your total rewards card you receive $3.00 then we had the coupon for $5.00 more off which came to a total of $23.00 for two. Not too bad at a Vegas buffet. We were seated pretty quickly after paying then it was on.\n\nThere were variations of eggs, french toast, bacon, pancakes and even crepes (which we totally worth the wait, by the way). There weren't as many desserts as I hoped but the ones they had were definitely quality.\n\nI will certainly be back again. Worth every penny!	3
	1731	Oh wow ! I hear about this place a lot.... I went to get some burgers and shrimp. Well , what can I say ... I try to look for something positive on places I go eat, this place it was disappointing .... I go Order ,they tell me cash only... then I go drive to a bank teller for $$ , so I order, then Kids are playing around the kitchen ,I was like what the... few minutes later my order is ready. OK, lets see here , Oh Man! my Burger is so dry and one side is kinda burnt, the Shrimp !! all I had is the breading ..where is the Shrimp !! .... Sorry Pete if you still around , It really SUCK !  This place stands out by it's name only and the food it's like not the best ........ not coming back to Pete's place .	0
	1732	Holy cow!!! This place is ridiculously large. That being said, I got lost many times because everything looks the same, there are no real points of reference, the signage sucks, and there are very few maps. I pride myself on my sense of direction and this place simply stumped me.	1
	1733	pasty/past/\nNoun: A folded pastry case filled with seasoned meat and vegetables aka AMAZINGNESS! Yes, amazingness is a word. A friend and I had decided to check this place out, and absolutely fell in love. I ordered the Spicy Asiago Chicken Pasty: Spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies and mexican stewed tomatoes, with a side of sour cream and salsa. If you want to add a lil more heat you can request some sriracha. They have a great selection of wine (I'm partial to their Malbec) and beers and their happy hour is killer. \n\nThe ambiance alone is pretty sweet as well. We sat at the bar, which is purely lit with candles. The tables are set with black church pews with candlight and dim lighting throughout. If it's a nice evening they have plenty of outdoor seating as well. Everyone that works there was soo chill and laid back. Made for a great evening ! \n\nJust hope next time I have enough room to try their dessert!	4
	1734	This is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I have been there over ten times....It's on the ground floor of Renaissance hotel. The environment is very elegant and clean. The food is absolutely good. I always start with the mussels with fries, they will bring up a huge bowl of fresh and delicious mussels and crispy but soft fries. I wish they have sweet potato fries as well.\nAnd all other dishes I tried was great. The scallops, the steak, seafood, pasta, everything. Strongly recommended.	4
	1735	we tried Soho last week and now this is undoubtedly our favorite neighbourhood restaurant...live music,excellent food and friendly service are the highlights of this place..we tried lychee sake, shrimp and short rib and they were top class...the owner also gave as a free egg rolls which was yummy too...definitely 5 stars from me	4
	1736	Been a resident at Veer towers for a year and have heard nothing but good things about Mandarin bar, finally had a chance to check it out and unfortunately I have to say I WILL NOT be returning. We walked in at 10:25pm and were quickly told by 2 women that they were closed. They were clearly not happy to see us walk in. I asked what time they closed and was told 11pm at which time I looked at my watch to see that it was 10:25pm.. I said it's not 11, she said well we have last call at 10:30 so we can only give u beer wine or maybe a jack and coke.. I understand that it may have been close to closing but it was the bad attitude that has really left a sour taste in my mouth! I will not be returning nor will I recommend it to anyone. A high end establishment such as this should really provide better customer service. As a business owner myself I would be appalled if my employees treated their customers this way.	0
	1737	My favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. \nTACO TUESDAYS!\nLove the Salmon Y Mango taco.\nThe Pescado taco is also really good.\n\nEvery taco I've tried there is good and it was the first time I've ate cactus. Not my favorite item of food, I'm assuming it's categorized as a vegetable....?\nI love margaritas but I prefer frozen however they don't offer frozen just as many restaurants in the Phoenix area don't. With that said, they offer great margaritas.\n\nLove the environment. Modern Mexican, yet comfortable and not pretentious. Great selection of tequila and a staff that knows the menu.	4
	1738	"I already put all this in my blog that I'm writing about cooking my way through a Gordon Ramsay cookbook, but when I see negative things and the nit picky reviews I felt I was too late in posting this. \n\nI couldn't wait to visit this restaurant because I am so amazed by GR.  I tried very hard to not have my expectations too high because like others here, I didn't want to have one little thing go wrong and my whole night ruined, but try as I might my expectations were through the roof. They weren't too high, because they were met and 10 fold more. Below is my review \n\nFinally 5pm on Monday night.  We check in at the front and the hostess says \""oh I see you're big fan\"" to which I reply \""indeed I am\"". Then she says \""well we have a special seat for you\""  And where does she take me?  Right in front of the pass!  OMG it just can't get any better, not only am I here, but I'm getting to see everything right up front and personal.  So exciting.\n\nNext we ordered drinks. How cool is it that they give you the drink menu on an iPad?  It was very cool. Don't try taking them though, they're locked down.  (no I didn't try to take one)\n\nThey brought us a plate of complementary breads which were clearly an indication of the wonderful food we were about to partake of.  They were so good!\n\nNext order of business is to order an appetizer I had scoured the menu before we got there, so I pretty much knew I wanted to try the British Ale Onion soup.  I chose right. This soup is so good, full of sweet onions, Boddington's English Ale, and topped with Welsh rarebit. YUM!  must look for a recipe.  I have to tell you the customer service here is bar non the best I've ever had anywhere.  Chuck had to go up to our room to get a decongestant and while he was gone the sous chef was looking for him because his soup was ready, and I told the gentleman that he could just leave it and he'd be right there.  Well he wouldn't hear of it, he waited for about three minutes and threw away the soup sitting at the pass and brought a new one when Chuck sat back down. CRAZY!\n\nNext came time for us to order our steaks, and they wheeled out this cart of the most amazing meat I have ever seen!\n\nChuck had the American Kobe rib cap and I had a beef wellington.  I just had to have this also since Gordon Ramsay seems to take the dish so seriously, and I really couldn't see myself ordering it anywhere else.  I am not going to lie, the fillet inside of that was so tender you could eat it with a spoon!  I don't recall ever having a steak so good.  I probably wouldn't have wellington again simply because of how much bread is on the outside of it. Too much for me to eat.  I also ordered a buttered poached lobster tail as an accompaniment for my steak but I really should have done crab legs for only 3 dollars more.  I am not much of a lobster fan, but I figured if it was going to be good some place this would be the place. The taste was good, but it was still a lobster tail that to me seamed tough. *shrug* Not to mention that for $35.00 you'd expect it to be bigger than a prawn, and it wasn't. \n\nEven that little bit was a tad disappointing, it was still very good, and since there was so much else, Chuck and I split the bite of lobster and finished up our steaks, which again were AMAZING. \n\nWe decided to have another cocktail and let our food settle because we had our heart set on trying the English stickee toffee pudding and browned butter ice cream. The staff there was so nice both the head chef and the head sous chef came and chit chatted a little bit and told me what a gentle person GR is and definitely a genius in the kitchen. Duh I knew this.  Just a relaxing non assuming nor stuffy atmosphere at all. \n\nAll I can say about this dessert is my husband said \""OMG F*ck strawberry shortcake\"" Which until now was his favorite. \n\nWell goodbye Gordon Ramsay, until we meet again *sigh* \n\nThe take away from this was that I don't think I'll ever enjoy something like I did that night. Not just because of the place it was, but because I was with the love of my life.  He was so happy to spend that evening with me. I truly am a blessed woman.  I love you honey. \n\nThe only negative that I can say, were the other guests of the restaurant. PEOPLE yes I know you're in Las Vegas, but have some F*cking class.  You don't go to a 5 star restaurant, dressed in shorts and flip flops with crying toddlers."	4
	1739	"We stopped by The Noodle Shop before seeing the Lion King. I had the crazy idea that the larger casinos' restaurants would at least be \""decent\"", so I didn't check Yelp beforehand. I should have known better!\n\nMy boyfriend ordered pho and I ordered vegetable pad Thai. We split the seaweed salad as an appetizer. The seaweed was good but the added tofu was unnecessary. Overall though, pretty good. Since there aren't many vegetarian options on the menu, I asked if the pad Thai could be made with vegetables instead of meat. She said that wouldn't be a problem. \n\nOur dishes came and I was disappointed to see that my entree consisted of nothing more than orange, oily noodles and a few pieces of onion. That's it. No extra veggies, peanut crumbles or fresh bean sprouts. I'm sure it would have been acceptable for some hungover frat boy, but I expected a little more. It lacked the taste and texture that's pretty standard at even the worst Thai restaurants. My boyfriend compared his soup to \""mall pho\"" and it was missing the traditional condiments. \n\nOverall, this place definitely wasn't worth the price and I recommend skipping it."	0
	1740	Bahn Mi oh my, what a flavor explosion. Luickly I was seated outside for this blast of flavor. \n\nI visited the Windsor at 8:30 on a weeknight and it was surprisingly busy, but there was no wait.  We opted to sit on the patio, which ot my surprise was nicer than the inside dining area. Wooden booths and tables, padded chairs and corrugated metal shade complete the contemporary urban patio\n\nThe menu has salad, and various burger like sandwiches on the menu, which on the surface is nothing interesting, the sides list is quite eclectic, there is the traditional fries, and the less traditional,  Kale chips, fried okra, mac & cheese, sweet cabbage salad and more. at $3 each I think 3-4 may be a fun snack meal. \n\nI went with the Halibut Bahn Mi, ($13) Their take on a Vietnamese favorite. S soft round bun housed a perfectly cooked piece of halibut, an assortment of greens, and a flavored mayo. It was spicy, fresh and hearty, I highly recommend this. With any main dish you also have a choice of side. I went with the fried Okra, which was delicious, crispy, not soggy like Okra can easily be, and the batter had a great flavor. It was in perfect bit sized pieces too.\n\nMy table also got a salad ($9) with salmon ($3) note the salmon is smoked. This was good but nothing too special.  \n\nA small dish of pistachios is delivered to the table as a complimentary app, it is a nice protein packed treat.\n\n\nThe service was also great, I had just finished a spin class and was drinking water faster than a elephant, however my glass never went lower than 1/3, even after 10 refills. This was even more surprising as usually patios are the black hole of service.	4
	1741	Do you enjoy long form improv comedy?  Don't know what that is?  Think it's all Who's line is it anyway?  If any of these apply to you, come here to see quality improvisers show you how its done.  Stay for the wonderful and supportive classes.  SCIT is at the forefront of a burgeoning improv scene in Pittsburgh.	4
	1742	Pros: Pretty good burritos.  Good street tacos.  I have found better.  They do have really good Chile Verde.	2
	1743	"Pretty alright. We went in with a buy one get one coupon, and we might return if we had another. Ordered fish & chips, and a turkey burger. The fish & chips turned out nice, the turkey burger was not nice.\n\nTurkey burger's meat was spicy for some reason, and came with house-made thousand island which was also spicy for some reason. I don't mean an eye-wateringly powerful spice, or an interesting spice that added to the flavor profile, just an unadvertised \""I wouldn't have ordered this had I known in advance\"" kind of spice. Beyond that, the flavors and textures didn't mesh or impress. And I'm sorry to not be sorry here, but I've grown tired of eleven dollar burgers that are so huge that you can't eat them without a knife and fork. I ended up taking half of this thing home, and then couldn't bring myself to eat it because it was so unimpressive.\n\nOtherwise, service was nice enough, and ambiance was okay (construction going on in another part of the building, so there was loud beeping and drilling that echoed around the open floor plan). The five-starry reviews around Yelp are speaking of their regular burgers, so maybe if we ever return we will split one of those between two people. Maybe with another coupon..."	2
	1744	Sushi 101 is THE BEST. I was referred here by over 10 people. I finally tried it and now I'm addicted. Tuna is so fresh. Everything is fresh. Cajun egg rolls are yummy. $2 kabobs delicious. And, the fried rice is amazing. Love this place.	4
	1745	typical bar food,  not fantastic but edible.  probably frozen then cooked at order.  great patio overlooking green belt.  Ashley and I stopped there on bike ride to lake by ASU.  Played frisbee  in green belt below patio after brunch.  cool place to stop. lots of televisions inside but did not go inside.	2
	1746	More like bad egg. Feels like, looks like, and tastes like a cafeteria. Reasonable portion sizes. Oatmeal was dry; I had to add a lot of the milk. Biscuits were large but horribly dry. Gravy barely had any sausage in it.  A server dropped plates while bussing a table and someone dropped glass again right next to me, drawing blood with a minor cut. No big deal, mistakes happen. But an apology from management would've been nice. Won't be back.	1
	1747	Best ramen in town!\n\nThis intimate little gem was once a hidden secret. Hard to spot off the busy street, tucked away back in a tiny shopping center. Now this booming ramen shop is busier than ever, and the ramen is still top of its game.  \nOffering quick and cheap eats, this menu may be small, but there is nothing small about the taste. Kimchee fried rice is a must. Monta offers 4 different broths, numerous toppings as well as sides and like gyoza, fried rices, bowls, etc. Definitely one of my favs	3
	1748	Not sure if this was a rare situation but my first time trying this place with my girlfriend we returned the food from the carry out order we placed. The owner or manager was kind of rude when we asked for the money back. They gave it to us but we won't be back.	0
	1749	I love this place! This is such a great concept. I love the fact that you can customize your sushi and the FUKU chips are a must have. I think I've found my new addiction. It doesn't matter whether this place is authentic Japanese sushi or not. The fact is this place is clean, fresh and produces good quality food for your money. I've been in multiple times and I have yet to be disappointed. Plus, it's kind of fun designing/customizing a different kind of sushi each time I go in.	4
	1750	Finally tried Namaste, at Bill F's YERRAA suggestion, and it was pretty rad.\n\nFirst of all, they have Tandoori vegetables and a Tandoori Paneer dish. This is ridiculously rare, despite it being the awesomest way to cook vegetables ever. \n\nSecondly, they have the BEST garlic naan I have ever tasted. Seared close to black in places, puffy and light, salty, garlic everywhere, some ghee but not a ton. Better than the best garlic knots you've ever had. \n\nBut the service was kinda weird: our apps went missing, no raita for me, the spice levels on our entrees were switched, kind of a bummer. The waiter that we had, while cool and conversational, wasn't there when we ordered; perhaps that's why things got so garbled, as the hostess who sat us seemed very unsure of herself. The pepper plate that came with our (free!) parathas was overly sweet for my taste, but that didn't stop me from eating a ton of the tomato and onion chutney. \n\nThis place has the potential to be some of the best Punjabi food in Charlotte. I make the distinction because Woodlands does both North and South Indian so well, that its at a whole other level of awesome. If they can iron out the service kinks, Namaste will become my favorite North Indian restaurant and get lots of my money. We'll see!	2
	1751	i got the buffalo chicken wrap and wasnt impressed. totally something i could make at home. they are nothing special.	0
	1752	Good music, good food.... HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!! So bad in fact that I will not be returning or recommending this place especially for a large party.\n\nI had reservations for large party and everyone at our table got horrible service and we even got double charged for drinks that people had paid for in cash...both servers that helped our table ignored our table the entire time, my guests were having to leave the table to get drinks at the bar and we had to bus our own table....horrible service....don't bother unless you want to embarrass yourself and your guests.	1
	1753	A happy taste of Chicago in my mouth!  As far as I'm concerned it's the best Italian Beef sandwich in AZ.  I always get it dipped with hot peppers and I'm a happy girl.  Their combo with beef and sausage is also great.  They serve Chicago hot dogs the way I remember back home.  Even their cheese sauce for the fries tastes like cheese and not the regular canned toxic cheese.\n\nYes, the place is loud, yes the place gets crowded.  But I don't care - it's a happy reminder of home for me.\n\nCan't wait until they open their Tempe Marketplace location closer to where I live!	4
	1754	This is an interesting place to grab a meal. It is clearly designed as a tourist destination. The decor is over the top. There is a lot of outdoor seating, which is great. The place is deceptively large and quite busy.\n\nWe got a good seat right next to the pond outside. Our server was friendly and fairly attentive. We started with a pitcher of margaritas on the rocks. The margaritas had very good flavor.\n\nThe chips and salsa they bring out are good. The standard salsa had good flavor as did the spicy salsa. I would have liked more heat from the spicy, but it was good. I did not enjoy the green salsa at all. The chips were sturdy and crisp. We also ordered the Queso Guillermo for a starter. It had great flavor, but was saturated in butter. You will enjoy the flavor but will make you wonder about how much you are shortening your life.\n\nFor my meal I ordered the Plato de Mexicano. It consists of a cheese enchilada, beef taco and a red chile tamale. The taco was ok. It is good sized with ok flavor. The enchilada was ok. I would have liked a little more flavor though. The tamale was the best of the three. It was a good sized tamale and was quite tasty. The rice that comes with the meals is ok.\n\nThis is a cool place to bring people. That being said, it would not be my first choice for food if I was not entertaining people.	2
	1755	This place is OK, but I wouldn't go again. The bread was incredibly dry. There are a thousand choices and a long line that is rushed along. When I got to the front I felt panicked. I ended up getting the trusty #1 (Turkey). All their sandwiches come with thousand island dressing and mayo and mustard, etc. That was the only unique thing I could notice. Only one size sandwich. \n\nBiggest plus? Their drinks are huge and they have a coke machine. They also have ice cream in a freezer if you want dessert.	2
	1756	Listen, the place is kitschy, silly and if you are into seriously tacky Mexican reproduced goods this is your mecca. Unfortunately for the owners,I will not support bad customer service. Bitter, bitter, very unattractive couple works the register.I will not go back. I say, check out Buffalo Bills just down the road!	0
	1757	While this company says that that they have a well maintained fleet, they are old and in desperate need of repairs.  If you think that you are hiring Ambassador to make a good impression, you'll be quite disappointed.	0
	1758	I was looking at my past reviews this morning and realized that this place never did respond to my email or phone call.   What a shame.	0
	1759	"I only came to the old Aladdin for the Buffet that my friend recommended. But I was offered a special offer from them and stayed here for 3 nights for my last business trip to Las Vegas.\n\nI found the valet and check-in very friendly, prompt, and courteous. The room was very well appointed and had a great touch with a display of a sword used in the movie \""Highlander\"" in the bedroom. The bathroom was large and included a large tub and a separate shower.\n\nI had some packages that were sent from my office which weighed a total of 50 Lbs. but they were very accommodating and they did make arrangements for the delivery to my room although it did cost $10, the service was nice. \n\nThe buffet is excellent and you can find a long line for lunch/dinner if you wait too long. They include a wide range of ethnic food ranging from: chinese, japanese, mediteranean, mexican, italian, and continental.\n\nI get bored easily and found myself playing the only game I feel comfortable playing in a casino- Texas Hold em. No way am I going to play games where the casino has the advantage. I enjoy playing other players and in Vegas I always make some money playing poker against tourists and buzzed/drunk players.\n\nI am very impressed with their poker room. Although simply decorated, it does present an inviting atmosphere compared to most poker rooms in Vegas. The servers come by often to offere free drinks. Although I have stayed elsewhere on later trips to expand my hotel experience, I always come back to this poker room. Unlike other poker rooms (Luxor) it isn't full of drunks and the other players are very personable and respectful."	3
	1760	"i've stayed at the Venetian my last 6-7 trips to Vegas. i consider it my \""home\"" hotel in Vegas. The rooms are nice and spacious. The all-suite hotel room comes with usually 2 queen beds, a living room (pull out bed for some), 2 flat screen HD tvs, office table, tub, shower, big bathroom etc. Very comfortable room, that can easily fit 7 ppl comfortably. \n\nOne bad part about this hotel is if you stay in the Venezia tower.. DAMN what a journey it can take to get to your room. Eventually u'll get used to it, but definitely not the most convenient routes up to a room.\n\nThe pool area is off the hook. Tao beach is always full of people having fun, drinking, relaxing and havingn a good time.\n\nThe poker room is also a big plus. One of the best poker rooms in town! Be careful of the sharks lurking though. Plenty of tables, and plenty of players.\n\nAnother plus is that Tao nightclub is located just downstairs for a fun night of drunken partying. Yelp Tao Nightclub if you want more info on that.\n\nOverall, Venetian will always hold a place in my heart. 5 stars no doubt"	4
	1761	I came here with a friend on a whim before going to the movie. Because I love books, I was intrigued by the name. I like the interior, as there are plenty of books and book paraphernalia around to pique my interest.\n\nI had the hummus wrap, and of course, fried pickles to start. The food was just okay, but I did enjoy the atmosphere. \n\nI would like to come back for happy hour, because it seems like it would be fun. Also, the menu is huge, so I'm sure there are more things on the menu I should try.	2
	1762	I have been to Harold's many times over the years for breakfast with my motorcycle chapter. Last Sunday we had a reservation for 20 and called them when we were half an hour out to reconfirm and let them know we were on our way. We got there, the place was only semi-full and we were seated and then? ...15 minutes after arrival still no water or coffee offered. After 20 minutes of trying to get the attention of a waiter, half the group got up and walked out heading down the road for breakfast. After half an hour we were finally having our orders taken and all meals but one came 20 minutes later. After asking on 3 occasions as to the status of the missing meal that arrived after everyone else was finished eating. When we ordered we all ordered indicating separate or together but with only 10 of us we were amazed that it took another 30 minutes to get the bill. When the check came the waiter indicated it was one bill for the table and that was policy. So now we're up at the cash register for 15 minutes trying to sort that out and a day later finding that my credit card that I handed over for a $14 bill is charged $28. To top it all off, I had a voice mail on my cell phone from Harold's at 9.45am  inquiring if we were still planning on coming for our 8.45am reservation. I love the ride up to Cave Creek but quite frankly Harold's has some serious issues that they need to work on. I won't be returning anytime soon as there are too many good options in Cave Creek that have their act together.	0
	1763	Good idea, poor execution. Everything on the menu sounded great, but my smile turned into a frown as soon as my dish came out. Portion was waaaaay smaller than what I thought it'd be, considering I paid $9 for noodles and vegetables only. Then I thought fine, maybe they'd make it up in tasty goodness. Not so much. The angel hair was super greasy and not in a good way (I had an italian roommate so I  understand yummy grease). Furthermore, ingredient flavors did not mesh well (this was their own recommended creation, I didn't pick the ingredients). I ate less than half and went home still hungry. I really tried to like this place, but was disappointed overall. The food wasn't horrible, but I very much doubt I'll go back.	1
	1764	-Food: HUGE portions, very tasty, delicious, & fresh! Good prices.\n\n-Tortas come with either a side salada or rippled-style potato chips.\n\n-A small accompaniment of red and green salsa...muy caliente!\n\n-Service was friendly, but slow (we had to hunt down the waitress to take our order)...they all wore yellow shirts and had a ponytail, so it made it a challenge when we had to ask for the check.\n\n-We came in at 11am...but it was already very busy. We were still able to get a table, but they are very close to other tables...unless you want to sit in the lap of another person...\n\n-Restroom is very clean.\n\n-Pay your check with the cashier up front.\n\n-Parking is not so convenient. The spots are very tiny, maybe meant for those Eurpean Smart cars. It's like a normal size parking spot that was split in two...is this to give the illusion of MORE parking spots? Someone parked so close to me, I thought I was going to have to climb into my car through the back window.	3
	1765	I wanted to like this joint but the food was disappointing. We ordered the hamburger, pork slider, and margarita pizza. The buns were hard and dry but if you're into big buns you would appreciate this place. The fries looked as if it was just defrosted. I had to request for a new batch. 2nd was ok.  The server who took our order was pleasant. But seemed to have disappeared for a long while until he needed to pick up the signed bill. Spent close to $80! I was not impress at all.	1
	1766	This Wild Oats has actually been here for a while, a little bit before the Whole Foods craze hit.  I've stopped by to pick up vitamins and produce from time to time as they're the only place to carry a lot of items - or, rather, they were.  This location is out of the way and, seriously, if there's one thing that Sunflower Market taught us it was that one does not have to jack up the price of produce just because it' good produce.  Wild Oats would have gotten  much better review out of me if Sunflower hadn't have popped up.  It's a little too pretentious and pricey to warrant the drive.	2
	1767	How disappointing. I have no expectations or high standards, but to have to wait 90 minutes for a room, then well after check in time to stand at the front desk with a woman for another THIRTY minutes while she's on hold to housekeeping to see if our room was ready is silly.  Then the next morning we leave the room at 8am for the day and get home at 5pm and housekeeping is nowhere to be seen.  Room never made up and no one ever came.  Top it off with a nicely remodeled bungalow room with no fridge and NO FUNCTIONING AC IN AUGUST?   Epic fail.  Don't stay here.	0
	1768	"I used to come here before an exam. Grab a drink to forget about test anxiety, why not? Remedy is right!\n\nI haven't been back since I transferred to a different school until this weekend. I went here to watch the playoffs.\n\nThe seats are very comfortable and it feels like home except home doesn't give me bronchitis from cigarette smoke. The crowd is quite odd. You'd expect college kids hanging out but the times I've been here, it's a bunch of people having midlife crisis. There's nothing cute about a 50-year-old showing off her wrinkly midriff wearing sweat pants that say \""JUICY\""...I doubt anything is still juicy at that point.\n\nI like the drinks here. I have 2 go-to drinks: Slippery When Wet (vodka, blueberry and watermelon liqueur and pineapple juice) and Remalicious (vodka, cherry vodka, Creme de banana and Sierra Mist). I don't come here to eat. I drink and call it a day."	2
	1769	People giving this any more than 1-2 stars need to have their heads checked (both for service and for food quality).\n\nAte here on an evening and food was starchy, greasy, lardy: the sort of stuff only people who have never had real Chinese food would accept.  Still, the promise of weekend dim sum in Madison was enough to make me consider at least that a try.\n\nI get there, and pretty much 75% of the dim sum menu isn't even available.  Guy says football game cleared their supply, but that's not true.  When I tried to get dim sum on a football Saturday, they said they were cancelling dim sum because of the game.\n\nAvoid this shithole at all costs: bad food, bad service, rude staff.  Fuck Hong Kong Cafe.  And why won't an enterprising restauranteur open up some real dim sum in Madison?	0
	1770	"Oh my gosh I love this place!  Totally laid back.  Sarrah, The owner has never met an enemy and if you want to talk, she has the most interesting stories to tell!  Of course she is busy slinging coffee much of the time.  This is truly what a coffee shop should be!  Come to the \""Friends\"" coffee shop in Charlotte.  You will be back that is for sure!"	4
	1771	What's not to love?  We ate lunch here and it was so good we came back for dinner!  salads...great.  Steaks..awesome.  Great place to eat.	4
	1772	Burgers were not anything special.  The buffalo wings were mediocre.   They were overcooked and dried.  Good fries though.  I'd rather go to an In N Out burger.	1
	1773	Our bartender was rude and impersonal, to start. When my wife ordered a diet coke, you could see her disdain. We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back; in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wife's Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce. \n\nPoor food, awful service, overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or don't go at all.	0
	1774	Peter and Kim are so talented!!! I never leave disappointed! They are my go to salon and I drive out from Galleria  area even when I need a nail fixed! Very clean and very professional.	4
	1775	Nice stop to grab a beer while waiting for friends or for the game to start. Nothing fancy here. It's just your typical food & bar scene with outdoor seating for people watching. I'm not sure what happened but someone dropped there glass bottle from the second floor nearly missing a guys head. That would've been painful...ouch.	2
	1776	Don't waste your time on any other sandwich than the cole-turkey.  Coleslaw, russian dressing, provolone, and fresh/REAL roasted turkey, all on a hearty roll.  Portions are huge, pricing is moderate, and otherwise this is just your average sandwich joint.	3
	1777	I was picked up at terminal 3 around 12:30 am Sunday April 7,2013 by an Hispanic driver (male) in a mini van to go to the mandalay bay. It cost 25$. The hotel is barely a few miles away. He took the tunnel and the highway which results in a much longer drive and is prohibited and he could have been fined for what they call 'long-hauling'. I'll pass on Henderson cabs in the future. Unfortunately I did not find out about this practise until a few days later.	0
	1778	Very modern setting in the Crystals shopping mall in City Center.  Did not try the pizza but the eggplant parm was excellent.  The starter of Calamari was perfectly cooked and very tender, served with Ailoi instead of the usual red sauce, a nice change.	3
	1779	I've had a few things here and they have all been good. I tried this place after seeing it on DDD and it really is a dive. I tried the Royal first which is a sausage sandwich and then the Guinea's Pie. Both were really good. I would recommend take out though. The atmosphere is a little rank.	3
	1780	Great salad bar. I was disappointed that they don't have the chicken and salmon additions to the salad any more. The soups were good and so was the bread. The pasta selection was very bland and unappetizing.	2
	1781	Overpriced Thai food in my opinion and boy do I miss Thaipan. The employees here are friendly however I always walk away feeling like I've paid too much and I never felt this way when Thaipan was previously in operation. The service is swift and the quality of the food is decent. I still favor Siam Thai cuisine as my personal favourite.	2
	1782	Gotta give this place a 5 star rating for the food AND the staff. We've eaten at all their stores--even the ones they ill advisedly closed. All are superb. The food is just about the best--we like the pork taquitos. the green corn tomales, and the chili pablamos rellenos (not your grandmother's chilli rellenos). The wait staff and management make you feel like this is YOUR place. They used to make a fantastic queso fundido--encourage them, maybe they will restart.  Dos Equis prices during happy hour are worth the visit--goes great with the hot bean dip!\n\nDo it, you'll love it.	4
	1783	Love this place! Every time I come here I spend so much money because of all the amazing stuff they have. My boyfriend lived in Japan for a while so I'm glad we can enjoy a place like this in Vegas. The bentos they offer are delicious. They have a great selection of fresh baked breads, fresh vegetables, fish and meat, beer and sake, and all sorts of sauces. Their frozen section is really good, too. The frozen meat is sliced perfectly thin for shabu-shabu at home. I also really enjoy the frozen takoyaki. At the front of the store they have a little corner of decorations/bowls/stickers/erasers that are super cute. The ladies who work here are always friendly and remind me of the cute little lady on the YouTube channel 'CookingWithDog' lol. I'm really happy this place exists and is really like what they have in Japan.	4
	1784	I don't drink alcohol so I don't find the bar atmosphere appealing. I actually find the meat market vibe annoying. But they do a good job of keeping the bar and restaurant separate. \n\nNow, as for the food, I used to love their food. I have been to the san tan location as well as the scottsdale fashion square location. I have had their sea bass and famous macadamia nut chicken. It USED to be incredible. The sticky rice on the side was a delicious side dish.  \n\nI went to this location today and was dismayed with the entire experience. Something must have changed in the last year because, the service was slow, the food was bland and not nearly as good as it used to be. I am sad to say the sea bass, which used to be on my top ten list, was not as tender and needed a lot of salt.	1
	1785	Great place to walk around didn't spend much time in the CASINO part, but the roller-coaster is FUN.	2
	1786	"I am pleased with Brueggers.  Quick and inexpensive food that you can eat if there is nothing else you are tasting.  I need those \""fall-back\"" places for times that I am ambivalent to the world.  Today, we ordered the following items:\n\nButternut squash soup\nChicken spaetzle soup\nHam egg and cheddar on toasted onion bagel\nChicken chipotle club on toasted onion bagel minus lettuce (use the Turkey Chipotle Club as a base)\n\nBeing from Florida, the soups were a hot welcome -- I was SO cold today.  The chicken spaetzle soup -- think chicken noodle with the noodles replaced with dumplings -- was rather good.  It wasn't too salty and the spaetzle wasn't mushy.  I wouldn't rave about the flavor of the broth, but I enjoyed what I ate.  The butternut squash soup, while lumpy and stringy, had a nice flavor with a slight piquancy to it.  It is amazing that the butternut squash soup can taste better at Bruegger's than at Season 52.  \n\nSince I am picky and finicky about what I eat, I special ordered my chicken bagel-wich.  It took a little bit longer to make, but I am used to that -- it's a special order, what do you expect.  The staff was up to the task and were all blunt and to the point with everything they said; my kind of people.  \n\nBy no means gourmet, the bagel-wiches still had good flavor.  There was no undue piquancy in the chipotle, just some flavor to compliment the chicken and the tomato.  The addition of the toasted onion bagel was nice.  The ham, egg, and cheddar was average; but for being in downtown Pittsburgh -- and unable to make it home -- it is a passable substitute.  \n\nI will definitely return."	2
	1787	"Seeing the word \""hippies\"" in the restaurant name had me stoked, as them tree-huggin hippie types got to have some vegetarian food, right? Yep.\n\nI walked up to the lil window and asked about the veggie options, the guy behind the counter informed me that they have a cactus burrito and that it was one of his favorites. Score! Or so I thought...\n\nUpon receiving the large, heavily stuffed burrito, I bit in with high hopes. Those hopes quickly dissipated as I found that the innards of the burrito were primarly COLD. The cactus pieces were cold, the cheese wasn't melted at all. The only thing that had a bit of warmth were the beans, which weren't even hot, they were luke warm.\n\nSorry guys, but a cold burrito isn't going to cut it. Make that cactus, beans and rice HOT in your burritos if you want some customers. Melt the friggin cheese in there, don't leave it ice cold."	1
	1788	So I'm an established patient for 2 years due to a change I made to my health plan. I thought the change would help my family stay healthy. Dr. White is our primary care doc, nice guy. We've also seen Jeanine and Max, both also very nice. Office staff is nice as well. Here's my problem, same day sick is extremely difficult to get in. No one schedules an illness. Well visits are lucky to be made a week in advance, more likely 2 or more. It's fantastic that the office is busy. That means good docs and service. The waiting is crazy though. I got lucky today, there was a cancellation. Needless to say I'll be making a change come open enrollment time.	0
	1789	The charm of an old diner  -  something you don't get much of here las vegas with most of our restaurants consisting of multi-million dollar celebrity chef build outs or some corporate conglomerate.  So an independent is great to have.  Service is always friendly and your coffee never runs empty.  They also figured out the simplistic nature of food and beverage - cold food served on cold plates, hot food on hot plates and its all served with a smile.  Most restaurants can't figure that basic part out...\n\nSo on with the food - OH is the best independent free standing breakfast in the valley.  If you want a more refined breakfast, spend a bunch of time parking, walking through a casino, spending 5 times more, and dealing with a las vegas strip-union-pompous attitude server - read my other reviews.  But OH breakfast is very good - from there fresh breads, to their omelets, pancakes and my newest favorite - Lobster Benedict.  This Benedict comes with a good 4-5 ounces of lobster and its under $10!  Absolutely delicious and I'm not sure if I will ever order anything else on their menu.  I can't wait to go back and to eat it again.	3
	1790	The ladies here are so sweet! They totally made my day. My eyebrows looked great and the price was even better. They also have some MAC products you can purchase. I bought a thing of MAC eyebrow powder and it looks so much better than a pencil. I'm happy they recommended it to me. The store was very clean and modern. Two thumbs up.	4
	1791	I like Popeye's normally, but we were eating lunch there about 6 months ago and there was a employee sweeping the floors... then the tables.\n\nYeah Sweeping the tables.. with the same broom.\n\nFirst he was doing it backwards. He should of swept the table then the floor... so he wouldn't need to resweep the floor.\n\nSecond WHY ARE YOU SWEEPING THE TABLES WITH THE FLOOR BROOM!!!\n\nWe have not been back.	0
	1792	I have been here a few times but only after 9pm and mainly only in the bar area. It tends to be bit overcrowded with the normal D-Bags you find in north Phoenix bars.\n\nGetting a drink is an ok experience... not instant service but less than a five minute wait usually. \n\nI cannot comment on the food I have never tried it.\n\nMinus the local crowd you get in this area the place is ok as far as atmosphere goes.\n\nThe cops tend to stand outside all night so you get the idea of what goes on. \n\nPS - Someone stole my headlight while parked outside of this bar.	2
	1793	By far one of the worst fast food places! So disappointed.  Service is sucks. I don't appreciate how I work all day to earn $$ and go for a quick bite and get ripped off. It is not my fault you didn't finished school or dropped out and have no education and now your stuck working minimum wage . But don't rip other people off by the crappy service and crappy food.	0
	1794	Rooms are clean. Small, but clean. Casinos are huge and smokey. \n\nNothing special compared to the others. Except- the fitness room is included with your room rates. I love it! Most of the other places charge $10 or $30 per day. \n\nIt's pretty far from the good part of the strip though. But nothing wrong with a little exercise!	3
	1795	I got the all you can eat spare ribs and chicken.  I tried a chicken leg first and all I could taste was smoke.  The leg and thigh weren't that bad despite the heavy smoke.  The breast was dry.\n\nNext I tried the ribs.  They were tender,but for some reason they tasted like sausage.  Maybe they were smoked with sausage.\n\nThe baked beans were pretty good.  They had a hint heat, which is good.\n\nThe coleslaw is what hurt.  I could taste apple and it is vinegar based I believe, which I like, but it looked and tasted old. \n\nBottom line is I've had better BBQ in the Madison area.	1
	1796	The best Thai food in Vegas... baby!  Try to time your visit to be at a non-peak time so don't have to wait so long for a table, as it gets busy here.  \n\nThe chicken pad thai was extraordinary!  Overall, prices are very reasonable (especially for a busy restaurant in Las Vegas). \n\nI have been here right as they were closing and they held the kitchen open until I got my order in.  Now that's service!  Will be sure to return.  \n\nLotus of Siam, if I ever become a famous songwriter, then I will write a song just for you!	4
	1797	I bookmarked this place and have really been wanting to try it. Last time I was here it was only called Pearl and was completely different. \n\nI loved it! I ordered the Rice Krispy roll. If I remember correctly, it comes with cream cheese, avocado, eel sauce, and salmon I believe. For drinks, I ordered the Hibiscus Cosmo. It comes with vodka, sake, and a hibiscus syrup that makes it very flavorful. \n\nThe best thing about this place was the ambiance. You walk in and you get the elegant, classy feel to it. The way they have it set up, there's a piano right in the middle,  and tables all around the room. The guy who played the piano was amazing. It's such a great date spot AND they also have happy hour! Our waiter was great, sociable, friendly and very knowledgeable. I'll definitely be back!	3
	1798	I've been here three times.  The first time was actually for dinner - it was pretty decent.  Very nice, great service and tasty stuff on the menu...although, I had a bad experience because it was the first time I had duck - didn't quite care for it, but that's not to suggest it wasn't a very nice place.\n\nThe other two times I had been there were for professional receptions/meetings, both of them were good.  The snacks/finger food was fresh and delicious.\n\nGreat atmosphere too!	3
	1799	"Man I wish I was cool enough to work at Pita Jungle.\nHere we go....really good food, service...needs serious help.\nI have been to 3 Pita Jungle locations, and every location, same story.\nThey hire only one type of person. The art school drop out that thinks they are so cool they shouldn't have to get you drinks. It's such a shame. The food is really good and semi healthy, however the staff is such a buzz kill.\n\nMy last visit, my waiter was either stoned or drunk, i couldn't tell. He looked annoyed he even had to say hi let alone attempt to get our order right. After F* up our order twice, he sat in the corner gabbing with another server about how hungover he was and couldn't wait to be off. \nMy girlfriend spent several minutes trying to flag someone down for our check, but no one could be bothered. I guess when you have drinking stories to share--who cares about getting paid? If they would hire new staff and adopt the mantra \""care about our customers\"" then maybe I would go back..."	2
	1800	Made reservations via OpenTable for 7:30PM but arrived early and was seated immediately. The setup of the restaurant is classic bistro but not crowded. We chose several dishes from the menu to enjoy and each one was prepared exceedingly well, though french fries were over salted. The service was well paced and classic. The wait staff extremely well trained and mannered. Everything about Bouchon screams excellence.	4
	1801	"Oh Pavement. You broke me. For years I flirted with the very dangerous habit of shoes; always looking and never touching for fear I would cross the line of wearing shoes to being worn by shoes if I ever strayed from my Converse. You see how something wrecks havoc on your friends' lives (Discover card bills, overflowing shoe racks, three hour detours to the Coach outlet store) and you hope you're strong enough to avoid it, but ultimately, you're not. \n\nPavement, with its dark walls, country-chic charm, garment racks of artsy frocks and lines of boots pumps and sandals delivers on all promises of helping you find express your stylish and quintessentially feminine side. Part of what flipped my brainswitch from, 'I want it' to 'I need it,' was seeing shoes that I haven't seen anywhere else; for me that makes Pavement a standout boutique. I went in there, fell in love with some grey motorcycle boots and three months later, when I was still thinking about them (\""They're so...grey?!\""), I finally went back and bought them. Having merchandise that haunts you is also the mark of a good boutique.\n\nAnd here's the thing, the stuff is expensive, but it's not second-mortgage-on-the-house expensive (I'm looking at you Louboutin). You're going to pay $150 - 250 for a pair of boots or pumps, but let's be honest: you're going to wear them forever and love them every time you do. The small selection of clothes and jewelry are cute, and you might want to throw a bangle or two in your bag, but in the end they're just not as spectacularly satisfying as the shoes."	3
	1802	With the explosion of coffee shops in CenPho these days (Fair trade, Royal, Copper Star, Hob Nobs, Lola at the Gold Spot, Sbuck$, and the soon to come Giant) its going to be hard for me to get over here routinely.  The coffee tastes similar to other places that I've just listed and the ambiance is just confusing. Is it an art gallery, a boutique, a coffee shop - I'd just prefer it picked one.\n\nThe best way that I experience this place is grab a coffee and dessert to go. The lack of seating just makes it tough for me to want to routinely come back and relax. The desserts (especially the cupcakes) are truly tasty, and you should go out an try them.\n\nAt the end of the day though, there are other options.	1
	1803	Stopped in for dinner on a Thurs night. Place was very slow and quiet.  The only thing I really thought was good were the wings. I ordered the Mom's Special spaqet and meatballs. Pasta overcooked with water at the base of the bowl. Sauce was dried out and too chunky. My brothers lazagna was so so. He got his salad for his app but my soup never came. Didn't realize that till the next day lol. Oh well. Won't go back here for almost $40 tab with tip. Girl was nice and seemed experienced.	1
	1804	"We used to shop at the other big baby store, but we had so many bad experiences that we decided to drive the extra distance and try out \""buybuy Baby.\"" Since that time we have been lured back into the other store by gift cards and great coupons, but found that even with those attractive offers we still regretted going back.\n\n\""buybuy Baby's\"" service is top notch. Their staff are very knowledgeable about the safety products. Everyone is over the top helpful and nice.  We have also found that we like the products at \""buybuy Baby\"" better."	4
	1805	"I went here on a Thursday night with 3 of my girlfriends and we had SO much fun...we stayed and danced till the place closed! It's a smaller club, but we really liked it!  Here's my list of pro's and con's of the place.\n\nPROS:\n-Free front-of-the-line entry for girls before a certain time (just look for a guy in a suit in NY, NY hotel handing out free wristbands for the girls). I'm pretty sure he can give you a discount for cover charge for any guys in your group.\n-Awesome music (top 40 music from the last 10 or so years). Plus, they play music videos on a giant screen that wraps around the entire club, it's fun to watch!\n-For those who drink, free bottomless champagne for the ladies from 11-12 with your wristbands.\n-Friendly down to earth crowd, classy guys (and ones that actually understood married = not interested).\n-Dress code is not strictly enforced (at least on a Thursday night), because I saw people there in jeans.\n-Not too crowded, there was enough room to actually...dance.\n-Couches that you don't have to be VIP or order bottle service to sit in! :) Not many places in Vegas have this!\n-The music wasn't too loud, so you could actually carry a conversation with someone.\n-Bodyguards are good at keeping the crowd classy and not trashy\n-Bodyguards did an excellent job of keeping the floors clear of spills, broken glass, etc. They constantly surveyed the dance floor with little flashlights to make sure the floors were clean.\n\n\nCONS:\n-They do not give you water for free, not even tap water! They make you buy a bottle of Fiji water for $5! (I just used a drink glass after my friend was done to fill it up in the bathroom...but the bouncer tried to convince me it was dirty water so I would buy bottled water. Obviously, he was lying. I told him I was fine with drinking their \""dirty\"" water and went on my way, he just shrugged and let me walk away with my tap water :)\n-Soda is also $5! Why so expensive, ROK?\n\nNote: The bathroom is co-ed. There is a bathroom attendant to assign you a stall for your gender.\n\nVERDICT: We had a blast dancing at the ROK and would definitely go back here again next time we are in Vegas. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they charge $5 for bottled water or soda, with no option of getting tap water (and the bodyguard/bartenders were a bit of a jerk about the whole water thing)."	3
	1806	Not a bad value if you go for the weekday champagne brunch ($24).  All you can drink mimosas is worth that price.  Food was acceptable but nothing like some of the more lavish buffets;  MGM's buffet is more standard buffet fare with a lot of breakfast options at this time of day.  \n\nDesserts were nothing to write home about except for the delicious peanut butter gelato...if you only get one thing from the dessert station make it that.  I'm not big on ice-cream at a buffet but this was truly top notch.\n\nDecor is generic and drab with definite room for some updating but everything was clean and well organized.  Not terrible but certainly not fancy...just middle of the road.\n\nThat said, our waitress Donna was so bubbly and nice that it made the whole experience really pleasurable.  She was genuinely warm and a lot of waitresses out there could take some pointers from her.  Thanks Donna for making an average brunch an unforgettable one!	2
	1807	Went here to eat and should have known from the smell in the restaurant that the food was inferior. Ordered the combo won ton soup and stuffed chicken. It was horrible! The stuffed chicken was pretty bad in regard to the quality of it and was close to rancid. Did not finish (or start)Walked in after shopping at Target and was very disappointed! Will never go back. Price of the food  does not match the quality.Very Poor.	0
	1808	Holiday lunch with the client. The cup of clam chowder was delicious, but small (such a small amount of yumminess). I enjoyed the palm beach mahi mahi and the lobster mashed potatoes were a great compliment. The highlight of the meal was the chocolate bag--a chocolate shell of a bag filled with white chocolate mousse and berries. Service was good, especially serving a group of 11. Conveniently located next to the businesses on Howard Hughes Parkway, definitely walkable if it is not raining.	3
	1809	"After a night at le Cafe, I felt compelled to create a yelp account and reflect on the unbelievably poor service provided to us by the waitstaff. Being a patron of Paris Las Vegas and Ballys for over 20 years, I was shocked to see how rude and patronizing the workers here were.\n\nAfter being seated, we waited about 15 minutes until we were approached by a busboy who took our drink order. He assured us that our waitress would soon come and take our order, yet it took about 20 minutes more (a conservative estimate) for the waitress to show up. Meanwhile, our drinks were MIA, so I asked to see the manager.\n\n What a spit in the face it was when, 10 minutes later, a disgruntled gentleman (Mr. Manager) approached our table, and unapologetically told us to be more patient. When I told him that we were being neglected, he responded with \""what do you want me to do about it?\"" then proceeded to walk away, mumbling insults under his breath. 40 minutes later our food came, tasty but nothing special. \n\nThe management at this establishment need to understand that their customers are not cattle, nor are we fools. Shame on you Mr. Manager for treating us so rudely. I will never return here for a meal, and neither should you, unless your looking for a way to kill 2 hours while you're starving."	0
	1810	Not a bad pizza place. You can always come here if the lines at Ian's are too long. \n\nI don't recommend buying pizzas by the slices here since they are relatively expensive. But if you take out or dine in with a group and get a whole pizza to share, it'll be pretty worth it. I like the fact that this place offers 20-inch pizzas. I'm always game for a bigger fill of pizza. \n\nPizza Di Roma isn't usually that busy, so you'd be able to find seating or order pretty quickly.	2
	1811	Ordered the prime rib special. It was very good and tasty. The service was great also.	4
	1812	This place is not good! The waiter was incomprehensible and the food is yucky. You're friends are going to say it's fine but don't give into peer pressure! The end!	0
	1813	My partner and I went to Eddie's House prior to her art show opening at a nearby gallery.  We planned on Eddie's as a start to a very special evening.  \n\nWe were seated on the patio and it took our waiter 7 minutes to greet us and ask us if we would like drinks.  We ordered drinks and waited another 10 minutes for them to arrive.  When he brought them he made no mention of the long wait.  We ordered an appetizer to share and then a large vegetable platter to share as our main course.  He brought everything out at once which was not what we asked for.  We ate our dinner and asked for the bill upon completion as we were leaving to get to the art show.  We waited and waited...and waited.  I went inside to try to find him with no luck.  20 minutes later he brought the bill out.   \n\nThe food was average and over priced.  We were charged for a small dish of extra pita bread to supplement the original small serving that arrived with the hummus. \n \nAll in all it was a disappointing experience due primarily to the dismissive behavior by our waiter.  \n\nI called Eddie's House the next day to share my feedback and got Eddie on the phone.   I started telling him about my experience and he he acted like I was interrupting him.    He asked if he could call me right back and confirmed my phone number with me.  He never called back.  \n\nI will never return to Eddie's House after this poor example of customer service.  There are too many other quality restaurants in Scottsdale to dine in who treat customers like they are worth the effort to be courteous.	0
	1814	Been here couple of times. Food is decent. My issue is the rude servers especially one old Korean lady. We asked for something so simple that every other Korean place I have been ro has on the menu (pork kim chi soup) and for the second time were here she disappeared and five mins latter a white guy took our order.. So rude from ehen we walked in till ignoring us. Wont be back!	1
	1815	As some have accurately described, it is all about the ambiance here. Romantic as anything, dark, sweet little corners and curves....so nice. Came before the Cirque show for a 3 course dinner.\n\nAs one walks in, it is almost like dining in those underground cave taverns of Europe. A room divider is comprised entirely of hundreds of encased wine bottles on display. The chef's table private room is expansive.\n\nMy warm spinach salad with lardons and chevre vinaigrette was tasty. So was the stellar bread basket. No exaggeration: the croustillante and moelleux from their baguette made me devour another basket of just that variety: perfect bread! Loved most the sourdough; great ratios.\n\nNext came my  12-oz NY strip, ordered medium. Done and prepped with a SW inspired dry rub, complemented with a salsa verde concocted sauce. Almost like a chimichurri. Asked for medium...cooked perfectly. But waay tougher than I had expected.\n\nGlasses of bubbly are reasonably priced.\n\nThe cheesecake with the sour cherry compote and cream inside of a tuille stole the entire show. A sucker for cheesecake, this plate was stunning, in presentation, form, and taste. Quite good.\n\nMy service was impeccable, save when i needed them in the end to get the bill. Other than that, attentive and quick. At times, almost too quick. Glad I have this Alsace-born Vongerichten establishment to compare Shanghai Nougatine to.	2
	1816	Ok, I was in the mood for some hawaiian food and this was a place close to where I live. The lau lau was what I was craving and at least they do this right. Customer service sucks, the female cashier has an attitude and at the end of our meal my friend and I wanted some bags to takehome our leftovers so the oil wouldn't dirty the car. Waited a couple minutes and nobody came, the chef saw me and didn't say anything, finally, I just got the bags myself. Seriously, where's the aloha spirit?	2
	1817	"Bad attitude and bad policy overrides any kind of food here. No coffee while waiting - that's a first at a brunch place. Curt responses to EVERY question with a bit of pretentiousness that makes me say, \""What did I do wrong?\""  Perhaps Vegas is not used to brunch culture.  I cannot recommend this place unless you wanted to be treated like you're not welcome and they don't want your business."	0
	1818	I moved to north last Vegas from California last week and was in need of a nail salon. I feel like I've found the holy grail! Michelle did my nails and I haven't had a better experience at any other nail salon. Honestly I've always bounced around salons trying to find something that's good quality and great service. This is both. I'm going in next week for a spa pedicure which she swears are amazing so I'll update then! If you're looking for a place id honestly recommend stopping in. I always call for an apt. Just setting yourself up for better service. Thank you Michelle for such great service !	4
	1819	"Yes, I made the idiot mistake of staying there the year after I swore I would never stay there again! Why? Because I was there for VLV (www.vivalasvegas.net) and the Orleans was sold out. I had to have a place in West Vegas and my options were limited. I said what could happen a second time? Omigod, if only I had known...\n\nIn 2008 I was gambling and one of their floor jockeys asked if I wanted a Palms plastic card. I would get $10 of free playing money. Being the cheapskate that I am, I said \""why not?\"" and filled out the paper work. A couple hours later, I was sitting in the same area, and a security person walked up to me and asked for my driver's license. I had gone up to my room and had come back with only my room key, an atm card and lipstick (I thought - the essentials in life.) My mistake, I forgot my i.d., the other essential in life. Whoo boy, would I regret forgetting that! \n\nThis security bloke started berating me in front of all the other persons around  me about being a liar, a this and a that. I had no idea what he was talking about, but I gathered that somehow he thought I had used a fake i.d. to get the house plastic card.\n\nI asked him to accompany me to my room to get my i.d. which he agreed to. When we did so and he saw my i.d., he went on and on about in all the years he had been doing security, he had never been wrong about anything. When I asked him (and then the hotel) for an apology, he (and then the hotel) told me I should be FLATTERED that my age had been mistaken in such a fashion.\n\nNevermind that I had been berated, humiliated and lost an hour of my personal time marching around with this security yahoo - I should be greatful for this, to prove how youthful I appear! So that was last year.\n\nThis year made last year look like a walk in the park. This year I arrive and find the first hour in my room that my bags got switched somewhere along the way (I thought it was at the airport, it turns out it was the shuttle van driver who gave my bag to someone else.)  After a frantic, unrewarding $40 cab ride to the air-port and back, I am waiting in the casino for own bag.\n\nAs I am sitting at a slot machine utterly exhausted. I turn my head for one second, only to turn back and see that my purse is gone! I get up and look down the isle. I see a large stumbling man with either a large leopard tumor under his shirt or my purse. I start screaming at the top of my lungs \""stop thief!\"" Does anyone stop the thief? What do you think? This is a HUGE casino supposedly filled to the brim with security watching their gazillions of money from being stolen. But where are they? \n\nI am screaming and yelling as I grab the man and grab my purse. I hold on to him so someone can grab him and arrest him. I repeat I am SCREAMING like I have been stabbed 100 times and all the pit bosses and dealers and people at the tables are staring at me and doing nothing! This man could have a gun or a knife! How liable would the casino be then if he stabbed or shot me?\n\nSo the guy slowly and I mean SLOWLY meanders out of the casino, like he has a hankering to gamble somewhere else. I am hanging on to him and he is dragging me out of the place. As he drags me out of the door, a real life security guy outside sees our commotion going on and I scream at him \""Are you going to fucking do something or what? This man just stole my bag and no one inside is helping me. Help me!!!\"" He comes up to me and gets the story (this guy isn't even walking away from us. He could care less.)\n\nThe security guy says \""Do you want us to arrest him?\"" THEN the guy gets a fire under his feet and starts to walk fast and I mean fast. The security guy follows him and yells at me and I say \""NO!\"" \n\nNow you are asking me, why did I say no? First of all, I do not plan to sit in a little cramped office in the casino my first night after all I have been through already, filing a police report for hours. After that, I will be called back to Vegas for depositions and a trial. Then the asshole will be let off on probation. Hell no. Not going through all that. And second, I am waaaay more pissed off at the casino now then I am at the guy. He was just being a thief. But they did nothing and put my health and well being at great risk.\n\nAfter this is over, I hear this security guy try to get the story of why no one came to help me from the security people inside. He gets the tape and sure enough sees no one helped me. He does seem angry. He gets me a coke and then...walks away and leaves me! The next three days I try connecting with someone to find out what happens. My last day I finally demand to see head of security.. Guess who it is? Yup, the guy who said I was underage from last year! \n\nI emailed a letter to the head of the entire hotel when I got home. He writes back he is \""horribly embarrassed\"" and does hope I will visit the hotel again. That is it!!!! Are you fucking kidding me? That is all you people got? Go screw yourselve"	0
	1820	Solid. Portion sizes are moderate but very tasty. Prices are very reasonable.	3
	1821	Granite City advertised the October Chef's specials.  The Bavarian Burger made me plan a date night just so I could get to try the meal! My fiance and I went to an early dinner.  Our drink orders were taken quickly.  However, that was the end of quick and thoughtful service. I appreciated the Gluten Free menu, my fiance has Celiac.  After placing our order we continued to wait for our drinks which finally arrived about 10 minutes after ordering them- the were delicious, props to the bartender.  Our waitress never asked us about appetizers, which would have been nice since we waited awhile for our entrees-drinking on empty stomachs!  My fiance's GF burger came first.  He awkwardly nibbled at his chips while watching the kitchen for my meal...Finally, my entree came out at least 5 minutes after his meal.  Needless to say, I was let down SO badly about the Bavarian Burger: NO pretzel bun (which our waitress admitted she forgot to mention was out of stock --- umm big part of the burger and an option for ALL burgers on the menu), no mustard, and skimpy kraut.  We scarfed down our meal and left.  Underwhelmed. For the PRICE and the WAIT we didn't get much.  The drinks were the saving factor.\n\nHonestly, there isn't a reason to return.	1
	1822	I don't understand the trend of celebrity chefs slapping their names on any establishment. This trend seems particularly prevalent in Vegas. Where is the quality control?\n\nPub 1842 provides an average experience. Everything is edible but not particularly memorable or delicious. \n\nThe service was fine. I will have to say that of all the restaurants we visited in Vegas, which includes Gordon Ramsay Pub, Mesa Grill, Spago, DOCG and others, the server at Michael Mina Pub was the only one to refold my napkin when I left the table. The servers have been trained here.\n\nIf you find yourself at MGM with no place to eat, Michael Mina Pub would probably be fine. You'll leave feeling that you overpaid, but that happens almost everywhere in Vegas.	1
	1823	I came in for a few screen protectors...was hoping to get in and out of this place.  They keep some screen protectors here in front in one area and others in an area towards to back and yet more in another corner of the store....\nSo I finally find them....now I just want to pay and leave...oh no....since I didn't put my name on the list I have to wait for my turn behind 3 other people with phone issues or are looking for a new phone...\nThis is B*LLSH!T....\nThere were definitely several people waiting to be helped at at least 7 employees stading behind computers with no one infront of them or walking back and forth like they were busy.  \n\nHave a seperate counter for those of us just want an accessory and leave....	1
	1824	The perfect neighborhood coffee-shop!\n\nI much prefer coffee shops like this to the Starbucks types.  Not only does it have it's own character, it has personality.  It doesn't feel like they are just churning out coffee and clients, it's a great place to get a cup and relax.  I went to get a few pounds of coffee for my desk at work.  I highly recommend the Snickerdoodle.  So fresh and it smells fantastic.  I use a french press at work and oh, the smell.  So yummy.\n\nA+ service as well.  The girls working when I visited this week were full of smiles and cheer.  Love it.	3
	1825	Rio has two buffets, at each end of the casino.  This was their first one and maybe the less popular one, but I think it's one of the better buffets.  Perhaps I should give the Seafood one a try.  What I remembered about this place was the stations, set up by ethnicity was pretty cool. Sure others have copied them, but 'm pretty sure they were the first. Like most buffet, some of the food was good and some weren't.  I'm not a fan of buffet, but getting sushi, although not great, is always a good thing.  Alaskan Crab legs is always a plus too.	2
	1826	"I love coming here for Whiskey Wednesdays. Every week they pick a category of whiskey to be half-off. They have a great selection and usually some off-menu specials. They really know their whiskey so this is a great place to try something new of you have discriminating taste. This is possibly my favorite feature of any bar in the area.\n\nThey always have a nice selection of beer on tap too (at a nice range of prices) and have recently started \""Brewsdays\"" with some nice beer specials.\n\nSeven Saints has some quality food too. Sliders, salads, sides, desserts... It's all delicious. Definitely try the sweet potato fries or beet chips. My only complaint about the menu is that, since I tend to order vegetarian, the options can get a little stale (though you can sub in a veggie burger on any of their sliders).\n\nMy favorite meal? California Turkey Slider (sub a veggie burger, hold the bacon), waffle fries, and the Southwest Chipotle Salad.\n\nAnd last, but not least, the atmosphere: Seven Saints feels classy, but not so classy that you'll feel underdressed if you show up in a t0shirt and jeans. It's a darker feel and the furniture and decorations are detailed and thought-out. Even when it's busy, they bar doesn't get too terribly loud so it's great for a date or a night out with friends if you'd like to be able to have a conversation at the table."	4
	1827	"I wandered into Dive Bar on a Friday night because I had a friend playing a gig here. I literally felt like I stepped into a time machine and was transported back to the 1990s. So much leather, jean vests, plenty of dark eyeliner, tattoos galore, and a lot of dark, dark colors on the patrons, and yes folk, I witnessed Doc Martins. In a bright summer floral sun dress, I stuck out like a sore thumb.\n\nI usually don't frequent watering holes. I enjoy dancing and getting dolled up. If I do go to a bar, I don't like them too loud, especially when I have stellar company and want to carry on a conversation.\n\nThe place isn't rather large. There is a huge bar in the back with seats all around it. There are several hi-top tables (like maybe 6) in front of the stage set up. Not a lot of seating and definitely not good for large groups. The place is smokey, which I expect in dive bars. The drink prices were reasonable. $4 for a vodka-cran is great.\n\nThe place was loud. So loud that a friend shouting in my ear and I still couldn't hear here. For shows, there is no need for music to be that loud! I was not into the bands these evening, one was rockabilly, the others were more punk rock. Just not my style or mood for the evening. \n\nLack of seating, a very specific type of patron, overly smokey, bathrooms with graffiti on them (the ladies toilet seat, yes the SEAT!, said \""C--T DROPPINGS HERE), overly loud, blaring music, and cheap drinks make this a very, very, very stereotypical dive bar. \n\nThis place is nothing special and I could not wait to get the hell out of here. Thank goodness for cheap drinks and friendly, attentive bar staff are the only reason it's not a complete one star.\n\nI won't be diving in to Dive Bar again... EVER."	1
	1828	The food is ok...its typical diner food...but they are way overpriced...My husband and I only went here because it was in the Treasure Island which was the hotel we were staying at when we were at Vegas.  But there are so many better places you can go to for much cheaper.  I mean...$12 for a turkey sandwich...I don't think so...	1
	1829	I went in awhile ago to see what this shop had since I LOVE to bake & am always eager to support my local bakeries. I didnt even get a chance to try the goodies because I was so turned off by the staff. The lady behind the counter seemed like she had an attitude, but hey, maybe I came on an off day. Since I have worked my fair share of customer service jobs I know it can be hard to always be cheerful, but I ended up leaving afterwards. I gave them 3 stars because I would like to come back & actually enjoy the goods. They have great reviews and ill update this when I get a chance to try it again. Im hoping I just came on an off day & that the employees aren't actually that rude.	2
	1830	The woman behind the counter told me she could not give me a glass of water due to the health department concerns over their sanitation. Disturbing for a place that sells food.	0
	1831	"We dropped in for a bar supper on Burns Night (coincidentally) and found the pub happily busy. It's a spacious, no-frills-attached sports bar with pool tables through the back and the seating area separated from the bar and pool tables by steps. If you and I are like-minded the left-over posters from Fringe shows are more entertaining to glance at mid-conversation than the Italian football game coming in via the projector screen, but  it seems like a good place to set up camp for something like a Six Nations game.\n\nI've been in here 2 or 3 times during pub crawls and it gets the job done. However, our pub grub experience left a bit of a bad taste in the mouth.\n\nThe barman was a pleasant young guy and gave off the impression of being new. They have a '2 mains for \u00a313' deal which is highlighted in the menu. Unfortunately he knew nothing about it until he wrung it up at full price and I queried it, but that's not really his fault. Safe in the knowledge I was having haggis, neeps and tatties the following night, I went for the steak mince burger + cheese and my dining partner the cajun chicken burger. All's well.\n\nSimilar to several other pubs in the city centre your cutlery and sauce turns up in a bucket shortly after you order. And then, the waiting began. 20 minutes passed, we finished our drinks and went onto the next round. Half an hour... and during all this time a barmaid was to-and-fro collecting glasses, 40 minutes - a table of two who were in long after us receive their food (you know that feeling of total injustice!) - I mean, c'mon! A little bit of proactive consideration here, you can see we've had a bucket sitting at our table for ages!\n\nMy partner eventually waves her down and politely enquires about our elusive burgers. Affronted, she shuffles off; never to return to our table nor make eye contact again.\n\nNearly an hour after ordering, two burgers turn up at the hand of the young gent, garnished with no apology or explanation until I say \""eh...just a minute...\"" and bend his ear a bit. Furthermore, my cheese is on my partner's burger! Back to the kitchen goes my plate to be cheesed, while my partner just decides to stick with the cheese she didn't order. What feels like a good 97 hours pass before it returns cheesier than a Cliff Richard video...which is a good thing.\n\nAs for the food itself my actual burger was very nice, it was cooked well, succulent and not too densely textured and the chips were fresh and tasty. However, the simple green salad came with no dressing and there was no coleslaw or relish.\n\nMore importantly though, the only apology we received throughout was the one I wrung out of the lad. Nobody asked if we wanted anything, if the meal was alright, or how it was after we finished.\n\nWhen you leave somewhere and the first 4 or 5 minutes of your walk is to bitch about your experience that's got to be a 1 star performance."	0
	1832	Review is for Hawaiian Night Tuesdays.\n\nThis buffet really lives up to its 2 stars - I walked in with low expectations, but figured that it's kind of hard to screw up Hawaiian buffet food, so how bad could it be? The answer is pretty effing bad.  \n\nI was lured in with promises of laulau, kalbi and lechon (crispy whole roast pig) - all lies. No laulau or kalbi, and their lechon was tasteless with rock hard skin not crispy. Some other reviews complained about the poke servings being small, but who cares - it's ayce and these were big chunks of decent quality fish. That, the fried rice and the chicken long rice were the only positives I found - they managed to eff up everything else there. Even desserts were bad - I've never seen bread pudding that looked like that, hard stale malasadas, pasty haupia w big chunky gobs of cornstarch in it. I felt guilty with how much food I threw away.\n\nEven at only $13 I felt ripped off with how awful the food was. If you have to do a Hawaiian buffet, do Silverton's for $20 instead. I also heard that Silver Sevens (ex Terribles) has a Hawaiian night coming up with a loco moco bar! So fingers crossed that doesn't suck balls too.	0
	1833	"The worst Subway sandwich I've ever had.  It's a 12\"" sandwich, how difficult can it be?  It practically exploded once the wrapper was opened. Eating it was next to impossible.  Tonight was the second consecutive experience like this...won't be back for a third disappointment."	0
	1834	Dropped by after one of my classes for work, since I was already on the East side.  The menu seems to be pretty basic (fried chicken strips, beignets and side items), which I think can be a good thing if they execute the few menu items well.\n\nI decided to get the Nest, after checking out their menu.  A few short minutes later, I was handed a dozen chicken strips fried to crispy perfection with the large chicken strips still juicy inside. The side order of beer battered onion rings were huge and thoroughly a delight to eat. The coleslaw was just okay, in hindsight I should have ordered their garlic fries. Of the dipping sauces, I only tried the honey mustard and jalapeno ranch, and thought both were decent.  Except I wish there was more capsaicin kick in the Jalapeno Ranch.  Along with the two sides, the Nest is enough to feed 2-3 people, at a very reasonable per person cost.\n\nI am rarely this far east past the I-15, but if I am in the area and have a craving for fried chicken I would drop in again. \n\nFood:  Overall, I enjoyed what I ordered and didn't experienced the dry fried chickens that some have mentioned.\n\nValue:  Varies depending on what you order, but I thought the Nest was a good deal when split with 2-3 other people.\n\nAmbiance:  Looks like a tiny franchise fast food place, but this is the only location.\n\nService:  Was okay.  I don't think there is much to taking an order and picking it up at the counter or having it brought to you in a ~12x15 dining area.\n\n3 stars. A-OK!	2
	1835	India oven is....ok.  Satisfying? Yes. Tasty? For the most part. The best thing about this place is the service. The wait staff are attentive and efficient.  The buffet selection is good.  If only the quality was better. Over all, its not bad. I would recommend it.	2
	1836	This was a good, cheap ethnic restaurant, off the beaten track.  It's a few minutes north of Sahara on the Strip.  You know it's pretty good because locals eat there.  There is not a lot of seating, but we managed to snag a table right away at 1:30.  \n\nI liked my chicken dish, and my husband had the steak.  Very basic but tasty.  Not sure how authentic, but the owners are Cuban, so I'm sure it was pretty authentic.  The steak was very nicely marinated, tasty like the Mexican carne asada but a different flavor.  The chicken special (they have specials for each day of the week) had crispy, tasty strips of chicken, grilled peppers, and rice.  The avocado salad was good, but so simple that you could probably make it at home.  I wish I had tried the fried plantains - will do next time.  \n\nIt was very reasonable, and totaled about $30 for two people.	3
	1837	"Just awful...\nWhy is amazon.com using these people??? I've never had issues with packages until they started getting in the game.\n\nI had a package last month that was 3 days late because the kept saying they 'tried' delivering it... I work from home and I was home at all the times they said they tried... apparently they never actually tried and whomever had it sitting around and then hand delivered it to me - never asked me for my signature (which said was required) and was on the phone when they dropped it off. No sorry either from the guy..... \n\nAlso I just ordered something yesterday and got a mysterious email I was cc'd on from ontrac to officemax saying \""Hello, The driver advised that we need a building name and department for this package. Please advise.\"" No other information... nothing... I didn't know what it was for since officemax addresses were on it and I didn't order anything from them. So I wrote back asking what it was about and I live at a residence... and then got an email back \""Please disregard this email. It was sent in error\"" - ERROR? how did they get my email? If my package I ordered from amazon is being shipped from OnTrac... it's probably going to be late... how much do you want to bet??"	0
	1838	I love Francesjean! She is great. I have been going to her for all my haircare needs for over 3 years. She is great at coloring, cuts, and extensions. She really takes the time to explain what she's doing, and how to keep your hair in great shape. I LOVED my extensions.... they were amazing! Call her today!	4
	1839	"Now a few weeks ago, my request to find kreplach soup that I sent to the RJ's Taste of the Town in February, suddenly showed up in the newspaper!  Now, I never read newspaper tangiibly or online, but I happened to check it and see my request, 8 months later.  The truth is, as everyone can see here, I found kreplach soup in town back in May.  I had not been back to Harrie's since my first trip because whenever I think to go there, it is after their 3 PM closing time.\n\nHowever, this weekend I felt miserable, and decided the only way to recuperate was to get kreplach soup.  Eric R. and I happened to have planned on lox and bagels for breakfast, so I decided to get a half dozen bagels there too.  I walked in, grabbed a bottled Dr. Brown's black cherry, and at the counter I declared with passion, \""Give me the largest container of kreplach soup you have!\""  The lady smiled and pointed to a big to go container, and I waved my hand and exclaimed, \""PERFECT!\""\n\nThen I proceeded to order a half dozen bagels for Eric R. and a small cream cheese (he had the Tofutti one in the fridge but I think he really wanted the real deal so I surprised him).  In the end, I came home and had a giant bowl of kreplach soup accompanied by bagel chips, then some lox (aka brain food), whipped out some capers and sliced onion for Eric R., and saved the other half of the soup to get me through today.  A combination of Harrie's kreplach soup, Eric R.'s furnishing me with love and kleenex, and benadryl have nursed me back toward normalcy."	3
	1840	Great local liquor store with an AMAZING beer selection. Their growler station, drive through and the fantastic staff makes this place a very unique store!	3
	1841	Love this place. Cute, quiet, and relaxing.	4
	1842	This review is for this location only.\n\nExtremely disappointed. I went to get drive-thru the other day;  I ordered 2 drinks 2 harsh brown, 1 burrito and 2 sandwiches. The server confirmed the order and I corrected her when there was a mistake. I drove by the window and gave her my card. (not to mention her attitude). She handed me the a plain black coffee! (I asked for a Hazelnut Coffee with creme and sugar) Then I went home and took a look. 2 orders of harsh brown were missing. I like Dunkin Donut but I will never go back to this location again!	0
	1843	Not wanting to take my negativity to a social media outlet, I refrained from writing a bad review for this place for a few weeks. Then yesterday, visions of that horrific experience resurfaced and got another episode of PTEED (Post Traumatic Eating Experience Disorder).\n\nIn all seriousness, I do feel compelled to write about how disgusting the chicken sandwich I ordered for lunch was, as it is dishonest to sell such repugnant chow. \nImagine going to the 99cents store, buy some type of boiled subpar pre-cooked rubbery chicken breast, cut is up in slices, keep some fat on it, keep it for 6 weeks and serve it cold on a baguette that looks more like a 20 days old gas station dinner roll. Well...it tasted even worse than that. You also pay $10 for the privilege of eating rancid food. \n\nThinking of it, I am not even sure it was chicken or if I was the victim of a joke or the cook quit that day. It sounds dramatic, but I can say that this had to be one of the worst eating experience, because 3 weeks later, I actually still think about it. I get borderline angry when thinking that anyone in their right mind would ever dare serve this vile sandwich. I had lunch there previously a long time ago and things were tasty then. I also had food at their other location lately and it was ok. Nothing to write home about but in all fairness, would not expect sensational food from a bar.\n\nPositive: Bartender was nice and friendly.	0
	1844	This location wasn't the worst I've been to, but it certainly wasn't the best. I expect PetSmart employees to be friendly, and happy to see me. They are supposed to inquire about the pet you are shopping for. I passed 5 employees today, and the only one that seemed even remotely happy to see me was the cashier. No one offered to help me, in fact, I don't think I saw one smile the whole time I was there. The employees at this location really need a boost in morale. I expect more from a state that is home to corporate PetSmart. \n\nThere were many customer dogs in the store, and nobody was petting them! Tragic! How could you not greet a dog with a wagging tail? In general, this PetSmart just was not a fun place to be. \n\nI worked at the highest performing PetSmart in the country for many years, so I know exactly what to expect from a good PetSmart. This location doesn't even come close to being awesome. \n\nAs for prices, eh... They are a little high, but made a good effort at offering many items on clearance. \n\nThis is going to hurt a little PetSmart, but this location feels like a Walmart. Step it up, before the other chain in town steals your thunder. Don't be afraid to give a dog a scratch behind the ear, either!	1
	1845	"I stopped here for lunch since I had passed it many times and finally decided to try something new. The reviews weren't bad and after standing in the parking lot deciding between this place and the place across the way I decided on The Liberty. The lunch menu is pretty small, but preferable to sprawling menus that guarantee they specialize in nothing. I decided to order a bacon cheeseburger (their Pub Burger) with fries and their tomato bisque as an appetizer. After sitting for a while my burger shows up without having ever gotten the soup. I asked the waitress to remove the soup from my order since it never came. She was very apologetic and offered the soup for free if I still wanted it. I declined since my food was already here and there just wasn't really a point in still wanting an appetizer. As I looked at the food I immediately noticed this is one of those places that serves those tall impossible to eat burgers. I really have no idea how most people feel about this, but personally I kind of hate when I'm served food that's overly and unnecessarily difficult to eat. I've never met a human that can open their mouth wide enough to take a decent bite of a burger this tall. I couldn't fit the burger in my mouth and after taking a few bites of nothing but bun or lettuce I frustratingly scraped off much of the toppings just so I could actually take a bite. I had ordered my burger medium and after my first bite saw that it was cooked all the way through. No pink at all, not medium. This is nit-picking, but for a place that proudly hangs a giant banner stating \""best burgers in Charlotte\"" you'd expect them to have mastered the art of correctly cooking a burger, at least. After the waitress apologizing for the soup so strongly I decided not to even mention that my burger was cooked incorrectly. Another reason I didn't complain about it being cooked incorrectly is that the flavors were there. The food WAS tasty and I enjoyed my burger despite it being deconstructed since it didn't fit in my mouth. The burger was juicy and covered in condiment and soft grilled onions that spilled/squirted from the back of the burger as I took a bite, flooding my hands with mayo and grease and bits of grilled onion. I'm just not big on eating food that makes me feel like I need to take a shower when I'm done eating. \n\nWhile the food did taste good and the service was good I removed stars for the forgotten appetizer, unwieldy and difficult to eat construction of the food, and not cooking the food to order (why even ask me how I want it, then?). Even though this place has good things going for it I kind of regret coming here and won't return. Your mileage may vary."	2
	1846	(Located in Planet Hollywood) \n\nFive years ago, I suffered from a massive hunger attack at 2pm after I awoke from stumbling in at 7am.  I remember walking to chipotle and the smell almost conjured up a puking.  If only I had a magic lamp and a genie could bring me something yummy...\n\nWell, the hunger gods must've heard my prayers because now, Vegas is graced with a 24 hr joint that serves quick, inexpensive deliciousness.  Hallelujah!!\n\nThe hot sandwiches are a hit.  When you go, stop by and stuff your face with the bestest Tuna Melt you'll ever have in life!!	4
	1847	Monta Chaya....  You might wonder if the quality is as good as the original one.  The answer is YES.  It's actually to our Salon Luxy Nail Salon.  We are regular there, more like it's almost my 2nd kitchen LOL.  Monta Chaya offers more Appetizers than the original Monta.  5 Stars!!	4
	1848	REVIEW FROM 2013\n\nMy first 6 months here were horrible. My first week here my toilet was clogged and I immediately contacted the 24 hour maintenance. Luckily I'm in a 2x2 because it took them a week to even come by and look at it. I had stains on my carpet at move-in that didn't get taken care of until 9 months into the lease. The student discount is ok...5% off. There's not really a bug problem if you get your place sprayed twice a month which they offer free of charge. On one occasion the guy did enter the unit when I put on the request that they were not permitted, I was in the bathroom less than5 minutes and I came out to find a note saying they just sprayed. The hot tub never works and the pool is nice. The 24 hour gym is awesome except only one door worked and the other one's keyhole was jammed. At this time I was already looking for somewhere else to go once my lease was up. Then they switched from Heers Management to Weidner and everything was made new. The property looks great, the maintenance could be better, but they're better than before. Sometimes they do not finish a job and I have to put in a work order again to get it done. There are weekly polls on Facebook to win $5 gift cards to Starbucks and the community events are cool.	3
	1849	this location has been open only for two years and in february,2014 has been closed! the location in planet hollywood, miracle mile shops is still open, since 2001. recently in may, 2014 another location has been opened in town square. please call 7026995597 for further information. thank you!	4
	1850	My wife and I have been to the TBs in Naples, FL and Sarasota, FL, and this one in Scottsdale ranks a distant third.  Our waitress, Lulu, was no lemon though.  She was attentive and knew the menu well.  Food was average, and the ambiance was sub par.  Felt cramped and very noisy.	1
	1851	Jewel's Bakery & Cafe is an excellent addition to this East Phoenix neighborhood. We enjoyed a lunch of both their sandwich specials for the day: Pesto Chicken & Balsamic Portobello. Each sandwich came on a different gluten free roll that were equally tasty, the chicken was super juicy, the portobello was roasted with just the right amount of tang, and everything was definitely homemade. \n\nWe were too full to try any of the baked goods, which include awesome-looking cupcakes, sticky buns, scones & cookies. But I will definitely be back to try those gluten free creations, as well as their quiche for breakfast/brunch.\n\nAll the staff was super friendly and efficient. As we settled into the cozy cafe, Julie, the Jewel's behind the cafe's name, stopped by to check on us! You can't get better than that!\n\nPossibly the best part, as we left, my boyfriend who suffers from a gluten allergy, smiled and said he didn't feel any discomfort at all. A sandwich any where else normally means lots of heartburn medicine. We are thrilled to have found Jewel's Bakery & Cafe and can't wait to go back!	4
	1852	OMG... So many M and Ms! It's like the world of color but for M and Ms! \n\nSeriously, if you are a fan of M&Ms you have to come here, they have pretzel, almond, mini, and every single color, the only M&M they are missing is Eminem the rapper! This store has all kinds of M's goodies, from cups, to clothes, and all kinds of wonderful gifts. I'm not the biggest fan of M's but I was still blown away with all 3 levels of Ms. However, the products are pretty overpriced, but I guess you're paying for the novelty of having a M's slot machine XD. \n\nOverall, a little bit too pricy for me, but a must see for all M's fans.	2
	1853	"Came with some family for dinner one night.\n\nExcept we came at a time where it was right in between lunch and dinner. The waitress was nice and charged us lunch prices while we began our meals. 20 minutes later after they added more food variety for their night crowd, the waitress watched us like a hawk and as soon as we picked up a \""dinner item\"" she re-charged us for dinner prices. I didn't really mind because I understand their dinner has more food (crab legs, sashimi, etc). It was just annoying that in the middle of our meal the waitress had to come to our table and lecture us about it.. I don't frequent this area as I'm not from here.. but I guess many people come here around the same time to fight for lunch/dinner prices so they watch their customers like a hawk on how they eat...Weird! Made me feel a bit uncomfortable. \n\nThe crab legs were pretty delicious with the butter sauce next to it! But all the other dishes seemed very oily and on the day that I was there they didn't seem to refill their pans of food unless it was near the bare bottom of the dish. Their dim sum items looked very dry. Their \""fried\"" calamari/fish, etc seemed like they were near burnt status. \n\nThe sushi was eh. As soon as they brought out the raw fish I was so tempted to eat the whole plate! Until I had a closer look. Their salmon had a very dark brown tinge to them. None of the fish was fresh or even looked edible really.. I guess it's hard to serve sushi in a buffet setting when the locals aren't exactly ecstatic over sushi as I am! \n\nThe great thing that I really loved (on their dinner menu) were the crab legs! (down side about it is that you have to crack and open the shells up yourself with no instruments available -- so it can be a tedious task just to eat crab! The plus side is that it's fresh-er crab meat :P ). \n\nOverall, I'd probably come back with the family if they wanted to. Just not too keen on their big-brother- watching-you style."	2
	1854	So yummy but they need sodas bc not everyone wants lemonade.	3
	1855	I was recommended to Roman and I LOVE my highlights and cut! I HIGHLY recommend her to anyone that wants gorgeous hair. 10 STARS! Romans awesome!!!	4
	1856	"Think Vegas Vacation. Clark Griswold is playing in the casino off the strip. Low end, small. Games like \""Pick a Number\"", \""Coin Toss\"", \""War\"", \""Heads or Tails\"", \""Guess Which Hand\"" and \""Rock, Paper, Scissors\"". That's the feeling at Hooter's Casino. Other casinos make you feel like you are in New York, or Paris. This one makes you feel like you are no longer on the Las Vegas strip. On the plus side, the rooms are cheap. They have a pool. Bud Lights are $2.50. Vegas on the cheap. \n\n\""Woo hoo... Big bet for a BIG man... Sure you don't want to save a few bucks for the buffet?\"""	2
	1857	My wife and I eat here a lot, but I have to say my favorite experience was watching a Monday Night Football game. I watched a few guys get absolutely trashed on sake bombs while eating at the sushi bar. Oh, and the food is really good too!	3
	1858	Me and a co worker ordered a couple of burgers from this place. One well done and one medium well. Both of our burgers were raw.  Took one bite out of the burger and spit it out. When I went to show the manager he said it was medium rare. Don't make up excuses fix the problem. That burger messed up my entire day.	0
	1859	"I'm having a party on Sunday and needed to buy a case or two of wine.  I usually just buy wine by the bottle, so I grab it at my neighborhood grocery or liquor store.  As this time I needed more, I thought about going to Total Wine or Bevmo when I remembered someone had given us a couple of gift cards to AZ Wine Co a while ago.  I found the cards and saw on the attached receipts that they were purchased in December of 2009--two years ago.  I called the number for their South store as listed on the front of the gift card.  A woman answered, and I explained the situation including card amounts ($100 each x 2) date of receipt and that the receipt showed them purchased at a location on Hayden in the Scottsdale Airpark.  She explained that the two stores had separated and the Airpark location has since closed.  She said that she would have to see if she could find a record of the cards in order to honor them, as they were old.  I told her I would come by today.  I packed up my 2-year-old daughter and teenage son into the car, and we headed out into the pouring rain.  (I have a zillion things to get done before Sunday and wanted to check the wine errand off my list.)  \n\nOnce we were at the store, I showed the gift cards to the woman I spoke with, and she proceeded to look for the card numbers in a computer print-out packet titled Outstanding Gift Card Liabilities.  It took her a few minutes, but she did locate receipt of both my cards.  At this point, she told me she would have to get clearance from her manager.  She went outside to find him, conferred for a bit, and then he came in to speak with me.  The man told me that his store and the one in the Airpark separated three years ago, so these cards are not for his store.  When I explained that the cards have his location listed on the front, he stated that the man at that store did \""all kinds of crazy things and shouldn't have been using those cards.\""  When I then asked why the cards were listed in his \""gift card liability\"" ledger, he got all riled up and told me that he didn't get any money from these cards and isn't going to honor them.  At that point, I became angry.  I asked him about his concern regarding doing bad business and losing me a customer.  He said, \""I wasn't going to make any money on you anyway.\""  I reminded him that maybe not this sale, but what about the future when I would be paying cash.  He said, \""I probably wouldn't see you again for two years!\""  So, as I left, I said, \""we'd never know now,\"" as I obviously would not be giving him any of my business--as well as making sure to pass the word about his abominable customer service.  \n\nI can understand not wanting to keep losing money from a bad business partner.  But, anyone business savvy knows that respecting your customers can go a long way towards growing your business through positive word of mouth.  This man could have offered to honor one of the cards as a sign of good will (after all, they were BOTH listed in HIS own liability ledger!!).  Instead, he chose to speak rudely and basically tell me he couldn't care less about my business--present or future.  \n\nI read the reviews for AZ Wine Co on Yelp today before heading out.  I saw that while people thought they had a great selection of wines, the customer service was pretty bad.  Boy, were they right!!!  If you care about supporting small businesses that care about their customers, look elsewhere--  AZ Wine Co is not your store!!"	0
	1860	I've gotten lucky at this Macy's location (at the Biltmore) a handful of times in the past... with both casual and work clothes, shoes, and accessories too.  The staff has been hit or miss, but selection has always been decent.  That is... until today.\n\nI had some time to spare after an afternoon meeting nearby, so I decided to stop by and check out their latest sale.  I was in the market for both myself and my almost one year old son.  I stopped by the shoe section first and was disappointed to see that many of the brands that they used to carry were no longer there.  I was not impressed with the shoe selection at all.  So, on to clothes.  I did find a couple of shirts that I liked: Free People and Splendid specifically (and bonus - there's a decent sale going on, but you do have to go through racks of stuff to find the gems).  But they no longer carry Trina Turk and the quality of what they do carry seemed much cheaper than I remembered.  I also asked a couple of sales people for help and they were not friendly at all.  From there, I went up to the third level to check out the kids' department.  Selection was not good there either; at least for boys.  They had a few cute Carter's pajamas sets and some Ralph Lauren stuff, but nothing amazing that I had to buy.\n\nSo, for a department store, Macy's is A-OK, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.  I much prefer Nordstrom's now for my department store shopping!  \n\nPS - I'm by no means a shopping snob, so I hope the above doesn't come off that way.  I don't shop that often, so when I do, I appreciate friendly and helpful staff, and of course cute stuff to choose from!	2
	1861	I liked Woody's a lot.  My wife, son and I got addicted to Orange Leaf when we were in Tulsa.  We moved here and found an Orange Leaf but wasn't as close as we like for fro-yo.  \n\nWe saw this one and gave it a try.  They had a decent assortment of flavors and unlike what a previous person had put in a review, the price per ounce was posted.  $.42/ounce.  \n\nStaff was nice and friendly.  Only thing I would say is that they should probably put on a cd player or an iPod and not have the music going through the cashier's Android phone. Just kind of interrupts the atmosphere in the restaurant every time that he would start and stop the music for phone calls.  The most seating I've ever seen in a fro-yo shop.  \n\nMy one complaint is there are less things on the topping bar than Orange Leaf or Yogurtology.  I personally like Cap'n Crunch or Fruity Pebbles.  That is a very small gripe but still something they could improve on in my opinion.	3
	1862	Went searching for guitar stores today and saw a Sam Ash. I've always wanted to see a Sam Ash store. I was not disappointed. \nThis place is killing Guitar Center! \nA nice selection a guitars and basses. Also amps and effects. I talk to a young cat named Vince. He was very helpful. \nI found a wonderful Fender bass amp. I'm seriously considering buying it. \nI wish we had a Sam Ash near Fresno. \nCz Guitar Center jst sucks.	4
	1863	"Based on my first visit, I would have happily given La Condesa a 4 star review. My veggie tacos were delicious, and I loved all the fun salsas. I couldn't get enough of them! Really, the only negative was the cramped quarters.\n\nMy second visit, however, was not nearly as good. On the positive side, I got guacamole this time which was studded with dried cranberries and tasted great with the strawberry salsa. I was impressed with the service too because my friend's order came out the same time as mine despite the fact that we ordered separately 10 minutes apart. \n\nThe tacos this time were awful. I decided to get the vegan tacos since the description of \""no pintos, no rice\"" lead me to believe that the beans and rice in the veggie tacos weren't really vegetarian friendly. I'm a pretty strict vegetarian so I try to avoid food that's been prepared with meat-based stock. The vegan tacos come with black beans which were absolutely flavorless. I'm not sure these beans encountered even a grain of salt during their preparation. The tacos also had iceburg lettuce in them which tasted dreadful of course. \n\nSo now I know I can't have their veggie tacos, and the vegan ones suck. No reason to visit again."	1
	1864	"Most times I support the local community. This was my third experience with Nellos. What a mistake. I'm sorry but the chains follow through.  Extra Sauce \"" yes sir\"". Not completed,  again by a compay i paid premium dollars for their award winning pizza. Young inexperienced workers and subpar food.  They didn't ask me what crust I wanted and i received the wrong one. For a pizza joint to brag about their success and not follow through. Tisk Tisk Tisk... Unless the management doesn't care. I will never never ever be back !!! Too bad a long block away from my house."	0
	1865	Okay so here's the thing these people are very friendly and have outstanding customer service. However I recently decided to change my own oil because I already had the tools and things I needed to do the job. Litchfield Auto has changed our oil for the past 2 runs, but it took me 3 days... Yes 3 days to remove the oil filter. Why? One might ask. I used every single method possible to remove this thing and nothing worked. So I had to remove the oil filter adapter along with the attached filter because it was on there so tight. On the third day I had my own neighbor give it a try and he couldn't get it off. So I went to Auto-Zone which was a waste and they were completely unhelpful. As me and my neighbor drove out of the lot he noticed an O'Reillys auto store which we then proceeded to go to. These guys helped me soooo much at O'Reilly, but it took us another 30min to get it off... They were baffled as to why is was so hard to come off. Turns out after they looked up that oil filter we found that they Litchfield Auto put the wrong filter on my car hence the difficulty in getting it off. I would've given a better review, but it just about ruined the treading for the filter adapter eventually leading to a bigger cost in fixing my car. And no I will not be returning.	0
	1866	Absolutely thrilled with their customer service. I just got a rescue who seemed to have respiratory issues - he was taken to a local vet who told me it was nothing more than allergies. Later this evening my poor pup had vomited 7 times.. I frantically called a couple 24 hour emergency vet clinics and VCA was so helpful and really put my mind to ease. They recommended that I bring Wylie in, but also allowed me to ask many questions and answered all of them. The gal was so friendly and really seemed to genuinely care about his health. She even offered to follow up with my other vet in the morning. While calling around, I got several quotes and $95 was the average .. I called VCA and theirs was $105... I will definitely spend the extra $10 to go here in the future (even though it's a tad farther) . I wish I knew the gals name I spoke to so I could personally write her a card. REALLY recommend going here if you love your animal as much as I do.	4
	1867	The service was not awesome.\n\nMy falafel was mediocre. The pita was kind of cold. There was way too much lettuce on it, and the lettuce was also sliced way too big to be practical.\n\nMy friend had a veggie burger with cheese, they put 1 square inch of cheese on it - what? And, it came on burnt toast? Hm.\n\nI will not be back any time soon. What a disappointment.	1
	1868	"Am I missing something?\n\nI've been here three times, and I just don't get why people like this place so much. In an area that's as saturated with restaurants as Arcadia is, Ingo's is nothing special.\n\nThe funky building architecture and the \""is it plastic or is it glass?\"" wine cups are far more interesting than the actual food.\n\nIf you want a good burger, go to The Grind or The Stand, which are both nearby and WAY WAY better."	1
	1869	Best spicy chips ever....\n\nAnd quesadilla was made quite well...am coming back  \n\nSalsa verse is awesome	4
	1870	The best barber in town period. Tara does a great job on my hair and the service in the shop is exemplary.	4
	1871	Pretty good but did not live up to the hype. Service was nice, but slow and no service after the food is delivered. Korean sides should be refilled at any self respecting joint but they are not here.  Even for dinner, there are limited sides, guess Im spoiled with at least 6 or more sides at home and other restaurants.  Will go again because its close but will experiment with others first	2
	1872	"maybe it's my fault. i see a sign that says \""coffee\"" and there are some chairs and tables inside and a \""free wifi\"" sticker in the window and i think: \""here's a place i can sit and get some work done on my laptop while i sip my warm beverage.\""\n\nno bathroom. no outlets. uncomfortable folding chairs. talk radio blaring. \n\nmixed messages."	1
	1873	Sara (bartender) is the hottest chick in the world!!	4
	1874	SHOULD BE NO STARS!  The biggest CROOKS I have ever encountered!!!  They said the car needed a new motor.  They found a new motor and replaced it providing a warranty.  That motor died so they had to get another one.  Ok, at least it was under their warranty right?  \n\nAfter waiting forever to get the car back we find out that as they were installing it someone drilled into the transmission putting it in.  So, again waiting for another motor.  Thousands of dollars were paid and then the car was in their shop again for weeks.  Finally, after all of that the car is returned only to find other problems that  were not considered covered under that warranty even though they were clearly things that were done during the motor exchange.  Then required to pay additional money just to get the car back.  \n\nThey were in no big hurry to finish any of the repairs and never met the dates they indicated.  They should be shut down for ripping people off.  Those that have had good service just got lucky.  They will get you too eventually.	0
	1875	Others have said it better and more loquaciously then I likely will so let me summarize:\n\nAn order of cheese curds, the Old Fashioned Burger with onion strings on the side and a solid beer of your choosing (perhaps a great local like Spotted Cow) is like getting punched in the mouth by a big thug named Delicious. A Mack Truck full of flavor is going to run you down like a dog, then back up over you to make sure that you can't eat or drink anymore because you're SO satiated. \n\nMaybe I exaggerate. Maybe.	4
	1876	I love this colorful, funky, eclectic diner that reminds me of a place I used to frequent in Laguna Beach, CA back in the 70s, and that's why I gave 4 stars, but seriously the food, although the ingredients are great quality, is just so so for flavor, prep and presentation and, although the servers are friendly and seem to be efficient, we usually experience a long wait for our food. But, despite what is lacking here, the food is healthy and it is a fun atmosphere!	3
	1877	"This is a famous place for locals and visitors to greater Phoenix area. \nThere are three locations to choose from (although one of them is in Tucson). \nOne of them I visited, I love the atmosphere of restaurant and it's friendly staff. However, I was not impressed with a greeter (person who allocates seats for you).\nIf you like thin crust and wood-fired pizzas, perhaps, this is one of \""THE\"" places in the states. One of their signature pizzas is \""Rosa\"" which has Pistachios (unusual but great!). \n\n* Service: Average (you might experience slow service during busy time)\n* Price: reasonable - Even though this is a famous place and has long wait time during busy hours and weekends, they offer reasonable price for their menu\n* Atmosphere: Average (dark and noise and some people may or may not like)\n* Food Quality: For the price and service, it is good and delicious!\n* Parking: The location that I visited has plenty of parking lot but the original location has limited parking lot (both of them are free of charge)\n* Recommendation: Of course, their pizzas"	2
	1878	This is the best Mickey D's I have ever frequented! They have tables with flowers! The food looks perfect, like it's straight out of the commercial. Plus, I got coffee & a waitress actually walked around the place refilling peoples coffee, like a diner. Wholly sugar balls! That's classy.	4
	1879	The service today really was disappointing and slow.  They only had one person that worked the cash register in the whole place and she was also restocking which took away from her register duties.  It took several mins just to get an acknowledgement and several more to place an order.  Funny thing I was the only person in line.  Normally, we never have any issues with this location.	1
	1880	If you're looking for something totally different but completely authentic, I highly recommend this. The Pittsburgh Banjo Club performs at the Elks Lodge every Wednesday night from 8-11. I have heard about this from friends and coworkers, and finally had the change to go last night.\n\nSo we definitely made a mistake by showing up late--the main room was packed and we ended up sitting in the bar area. You could still hear the music, but the view was not as good. I'd recommend arriving right on time, if not early.\n\nAdmission is free and drinks are cheap. A friendly lady selling 50/50 tickets explained that they use part of their share to pay the rental fee for the lodge while donating the rest to charity. \n\nThey also serve food. We didn't eat but everything that was brought to tables around us looked good! \n\nThis was a nice departure from the norm. I can't say that I would become a regular (you could tell some people are probably there EVERY week), but we had an enjoyable evening and I would definitely go back.	3
	1881	Borders has almost everything, and if they don't have what you want, they'll get it for you. The staff are nice and patient and once managed to find what I wanted from a Christian name and a vague description. Their DVD section is a bit over priced but they have a damn good sale. It's worth popping back in regularly during their clearance as eventually the DVD's go as low as a pound. The coffee shop is nice and the children's section has a lovely carpet. They hold regular events and donate to local causes. It's magazine selection is fab and I think that they are the only people in Edinburgh who stock certain titles.	3
	1882	"Hard to believe this is a Chris Bianco restaurant, at least tonight. I ate here a month ago and loved it and was so excited to come back tonight with friends for a belated birthday celebration. I am writing this from the parking lot -- that's how bad an experience it was.\n   The sausage pasta dish was nothing like the last time, when it was the hit of the night. . The texture was like paste. We sent it back and when the server returned with a new order she said: chef wants you to know we are experimenting with different wheats and it's all matter of personal taste and palates. In other words, if you don't like it you don't have good taste. We chewed through the toughness -again - because we were so hungry. The only good part was the sausage.\n  Service was a comedy of errors. We got our neighbors' appetizers, much to their dismay.\n   It's 114 today and was over 90 degrees in the restaurant. The hostess just said she \""thought\"" the AC was out. The people next to us were fanning themselves with their menu. Other people moved tables to try to get cooler but the hostess told us we had one of the best spots in the house.\n    Our waitress made no attempt to apologize for any of this mess and dropped the check off with no comment or even the slightest bit of recognition -or discount /free meal - for the troubles. Not even an acknowledgement that this place was firing on NO cylinders tonight.\n Absolutely stunning. It was like the whole place was in an alternate universe where everything was peachy keen tonight. There were some high Profile PHX area biz and foodie  diners there tonight whom I will not mention. We can only imagine what they thought, or maybe the kitchen was lavishing all of their attention on them.\n   I was embarrassed I suggested it for my birthday dinner with friends."	1
	1883	I had such an interesting experience dining here. My friends and I called in early asking about whether or not we needed to make reservations and we were told that we didn't because there was a lot of space. When we got to the restaurant, we were turned away because we supposedly had to make reservations days in advance? It was honestly just a really nasty experience because the waitress aggressively told us that we had no idea what we were talking about. It was just generally a very disappointing first interaction for a place that's rated so highly on a lot of food blogs about Montreal.\n\nThat being said though, we were determined to give this place a shot. We got a bit luckier the next day and opted ot have an insanely early dinner. We managed to get seated pretty quickly which was nice, and we ordered four different dishes: the poutine (of course), something... with fois gras, the melting pot, and duck in mushroom sauce\n\nPoutine was so solid. This was my first experience having poutine in Montreal which apparently is a big thing for the Canadians or something. But since I haven't had any other type of poutine, I'm not exactly the best reviewer of whether or not this poutine was worth it. It was definitely very delicious though!\n\nI'm not sure what the special was that day but it did have foi gras and it was this strange pancake like thing but... with duck? I really don't know, but I've always been a proponent of the magic of specials so I would just say that you should always order the special because it's a special for a reason right?\n\nThe melting pot was the other thing that was spoken very highly of on food blogs and was definitely an interesting one. \n\nI guess all in all, it wasn't that the food was bad, but it wasn't really anything mindblowing. I guess the special was moderately mindblowing, but everything else was good but nothing too special .\n\ntldr; a bit overhyped in all honesty... not a bad experience though	3
	1884	"So oddly enough a couple years after my initial review we actually ended up staying here.  And though, it's a wonderful hotel, I have yet to be blown away.\n\nWe stayed in the Salone Suite for our honeymoon.  This was a great corner room with \""strip view\"". Yeah well when you're only 5 floors up the view is mostly parking lot and the tip of the Eiffel Tower...not impressed.  Though the bathroom was humongous and the bed...oh that bed...SO comfortable I didn't want to leave it.  Amazing.  The TV was lackluster though.  And though unnecessary, the TV in the bathroom's remote was not working.  The blinds in the bathroom wouldn't go down and a plug and some lights were not working in the bathroom as well.  \n\nBut housekeeping likes to clean twice a day and I'm sorry - I don't use that many towels.  But they were a bit bothersome.  On voice mails.  Notes left on the door.  And even in person.  And then one of the 2 times we let her in - the woman took our souvenir glasses.  Plastic and cheap, sure...but they were OUR plastic, cheap souvenirs!  \n\nThe hotel itself has nice bartenders and great service.  The pools are wonderful as well.  But the lack of more affordable eating options was irritating.  I think we spent most of our money in the tiny grocery shop by the elevator bank.\n\nOh and be warned when giving them your credit card coming in...they put an over $500 hold on your account!  Just in case you're thinking of handing them your bank card that you plan to use on the trip.\n\nAll-in-all, not terrible, but I guess I would have expected better.  I think next time we'll stayed at Caesar's which was our original plan in the first place."	2
	1885	I can't attest to the beer, but everything else about this place was pretty abysmal.\n\nAtmosphere/ambiance - weird. Stage still there from jazz bar and it's just taking up space and awkward. Also feels like a cafeteria. Tables are very spread out and there's just not much to the whole space.\n\nFood - decent, but definitely not worth the price. We had the calamari appetizer, a salad, 2 kids meals and some beer and paid $52.\n\nService - waiter was very attentive and nice, but scattered. He forgot our main meal and then actually offered to take the item off our bill. Well, yeah. You think?	1
	1886	"Now i'm not the artsiest person ever, but i'm always down to try new things so me and a few others decided to try the warhol. It was set up nicely, but they had advertised a cash bar which there definitely was not! Also while playing in the solver cloud room, we were having a blast... Not being super loud just having fun... And the lady supervising said we needed to leave because we were playing \""too hard\"". I definitely will not be paying ten dollars to hang here again."	1
	1887	Every once in a while I crave Ruby Tuesday's salad bar - not sure why as I am not a fan of anything that requires a sneeze-guard, so I get there early before grubby paws line up.  Conveniently located just off of 77 on Arrowood, you can quickly get in and out of the place if needed.  \n\nI arrived right at 11:30 to a basically empty restaurant.  The friendly hostess asked if I wanted to sit at the bar, I said that was fine as long as it wasn't bar stool seating. I was seated in a booth at the back of the bar that was right next to the effin' server/take out door.  I was professionally dressed and took a shower, so I don't know why I was relegated to seating hell.  There's a glass door, so I was blinded by the light (wrapped up like a deuce...), the young lady that was waiting on me attempted to pull the rickety shade down to block the sunlight, but then the manager took care of it.  Which solved the light problem, but every time the door was opened (8 times while I was sitting there), I got a shot of the sun and a gust of wind that blew everything not weighted down on my table around.  The seating... sucked.  But the booth was comfy.  \n\nThe salad bar today was meh.  The greens (they have spinach, an iceberg mix, a springier greens mix and then a mix of everything) were looking a little ragged.  There was a lot of the tough white part of the iceberg lettuce in the mix.  Peas and ham were sitting on a liquid of some sort that wasn't terribly appetizing.  But, there is a huge selection of items on the bar, and typically they replenish it pretty frequently.  Lettuces, cucumbers, green peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, carrots, edamame, peas, broccoli, some mayo based salads, many different kinds of dressings, bacon, croutons, diced egg, etc.  I piled up my plate and it was good - although drenching things in blue cheese dressing always makes them a little better.\n\nService was fine and friendly.  She brought me a couple of their garlic cheese biscuits, which are small but quite tasty.  I didn't require much attention today, but she did a good job.  $7.99 for the salad bar is a good price.  I made two trips and feel I got my money's worth.	2
	1888	Nothing to not love about Toby Keith's. \n\nFrom the succulent rib/ wing combo to the sweet peach cocktail, I had a wonderful dinner experience here with a group of 12. Our server was unbelievably friendly, and was patient as we took time to altogether decide what we wanted. Drinks and food came out promptly, and everything just amazed me.\n\nMy rib/ wing combo consisted of two flavors of each meat, and both meats were just beautifully tender and flavorful. My mouth is watering as I reminisce. The mashed potato side was also wonderful, and the fries put me over the moon. \nMeanwhile, mixed drinks came in 32-oz. mason jars. My Georgia peach one was great--not too sweet, not too strong, a perfect mix that lasted each of us a long while. \n\nI wish there were a better way to convey my adoration for TK's. But in short, it's definitely worth a try: the meat is delicious, the drinks are fantastic, the people are great.	4
	1889	Had whole family of 5 for breakfast.  My son had a hair in his burrito, they simply took it back and remade it.  It came out when the rest of us were all done.  My son lost his appetite and they didn't even offer to take it off the bill.  They have punch cards for a free desert and wouldn't punch it per meal?  We had 6 meals and two deserts and received one punch on the card.  When I asked, they said one punch per visit.  Live in the neighborhood, won't be going back or recommending it to anyone who lives around here....	0
	1890	My friend got comped a $4k table next to the dj, which you think would be amazing. All he had to pay was the gratuity. Be prepared to pay all these set fees from hakkasan. After taxes and all the set fees, it adds up to 40% of fees on top of the $4k . I thought service fees are included in gratuity, in our case it was an additional fee on top. Gratuity was an automatic 22%. Anyhow that wasn't the only issue. Our servers kept spilling our drinks in the shaker and taking them away when there was still alcohol in it. They kept pouring nonstop that we had to put it on top of the couch. Which they proceeded to toss away when we weren't looking. Who does that!!?? The only people who was nice was the security inside the venue. Sorry hakkasan but the only thing you have going was the music. I would never come back unless I am forced to. XS still has the best venue.	0
	1891	Went for a birthday dinner on Saturday night.  The service couldn't have been nicer.  My friend was treated like a queen!\n\nOysters, margherita pizza, and I forget what else we started with.  Five had the lasagna, and every single one of them cleaned their plate.  In fact no matter what anyone had, their plate was demolished.  The food was that good.\n\nThen, the desserts came, and there was such an array.  Pumpkin whoopie pies, all sorts of different cookes, mousses, ice cream, creme brulee, etc., etc., etc.  They just kept coming.\n\nPostrio was delicious and worth digging through the horrid St. Mark's Square nonsense in the Venetian.	3
	1892	Very tasty but portion size was small for the cost. Service was slow.	0
	1893	This place definitely has a lot of hype surrounding it, but I would have to say it is just another tourist trap. The lines are about 1-2 hours depending on the time of day and day of the week you arrive. I guess it is part of the experience, but for a local, I don't find that very appealing or any thing that I would want to do on a weekly/monthly basis. It took us about an hour or so to get in last night and when we finally did we were served by a very friendly set of employees. We bought a mini chocolate cannoli, a pastry called a lobster tail, a cheesecake, and a Carmel cupcake.  The best of the 4 was the lobster tail, it is a crunchy pastry filled with a cream that was definitely enjoyable.  The cannoli was very gritty and I will probably not purchase it again if I were to return. The Carmel cupcake was mediocre at best and not worth the wait when there are places that specialize in amazing cupcakes all around the strip. The cheesecake was good, but for $11 you can get that anywhere on the strip at a larger size and better quality.  We always try these tourists traps as locals just so we can see if they meet the hype, but with the long wait and price attached to all we got, I don't see myself standing in this line again.	2
	1894	My air conditioner was not blowing any air.  It had been coming on and off for several days.  I looked on Yelp for reviews for air conditioning repair, since I know several people who had been dishonestly overcharged for work that didn't need to be done.  I found Number One. \n The office dispatch was friendly, and got an appointment for me right away.  Donovan was our repair person, and he was great!   The repair took about 20 minutes, and it was a minor repair.  What a relief!  I would recommend this business to everyone!  , We will definately be using Number One again !!!	4
	1895	Meh...had the green eggs and ham. Hubs had the big breakfast. Was okay--how can you go wrong with breakfast, though.  But I gotta admit that the fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome.  For the overall price, however , considered this restaurant overrated.	1
	1896	Best sushi in Las Vegas!!! Would definitely go back again	4
	1897	Im not sure if its due to the fact that its located in a mall, or because the mall itself is just outside of a dumpy neighborhood (guadalupe). But the patrons of this theater dont seem to have common movie etiquette. As the pg-13 movie was beginning, i saw a man come in with 4 babies. Yep 4 babies. Anyone who has been in this situation, knows the rest of this story. Movie theaters are loud. And no place for a baby. Let alone 4 of them. And its an adult movie. Not some disney flick. Anyway, with so many other theater options available i just moved this one to the bottom of the list.	0
	1898	"Yay for getting coupons in the mail for $10 off because it's your birthday! Boo for not being able to use it because the store is out of stock and makes you go to the Origins in Belk and Belk doesn't accept the coupon.\n\nBy the looks of the intro, you can tell what kind of experience I had. Not a fan. However, this harsh review isn't based on one experience alone. I have stopped by the Origins store repeatedly in hopes to restock my \""Underwear for lashes\"" that I have grown to love over the past decade. Most of the time, they have not had the products I have wanted (lip glosses included). Then they offer to call Belk or ask that I go there to get the products. I did that at least twice and the second time there wasn't anyone there at the Belk Origins because she was on vacation. (Side note: how do you not get coverage when an employee goes on vacation?) Frustrating to say the very least. \n\nThe employees are friendly and it's not their fault that they don't get enough shipment in...let's just hope that the company steps up their stock. If you have the time, the employees are happy to show you the latest products, especially the exfoliators and lotions. Also, the products are worth believing in: no parabens, sustainability, recycle, etc."	1
	1899	While waiting for some friends, we ordered some edamame and spicy tuna rolls.  The edamame was tasty and steamed perfectly, while the the spicy tuna rolls were good. Great for grabbing a quick bite to eat if you're at the Hyatt.	2
	1900	Best margaritas and cornbread! The diablo pasta is amazing, and you get enough for two meals. I usually do not eat leftovers, but Diablo pasta (and Alfredo in the Dark from Oreganos) is the only food I still like the second day. The cornbread, street tacos and trio salsa are fantastic. The Sixth Street frozen margarita is soo yummy and strong! Great place to start a fun evening in Scottsdale or Tempe.	4
	1901	The people I dealt with were friendly and informative. I was honest with the guy about how much money I had in my bank and he helped me work with in my budget. I decided to go back the following week and get the insurance on all 4 tires per my sister's recommendation. She said they honor it no questions asked. It costs about $40 to insure all 4 tires.	3
	1902	OMG. They have everything for everyone. The price tag is a bit steep but it is worth every penny. Mexican? Check. Chinese? Check. Continental? Check. Will you have a blowout while sitting and stuffing your face full of food? You betchya!	4
	1903	Heads up: the gluten-free pizza is not actually gluten-free. If you have an intolerance, don't take your chances. You will get sick.	0
	1904	Usually order wings and burgers, usually good. Switched it up and bought a steak. Did not taste as much as it cost. Like chewing on tasteless piece of meat, came with red potatoes that must of been doused in salt before they came out. And on top of that the service was lacking, a lot. Steak got cold before I could ask for steak sauce and get it.	1
	1905	Had the bacon and egg bagel combo with hash browns.  The bagel was good, coffee so-so, hash browns a tad soggy.  I'm not sure how they cooked the egg and the bacon as there was no frying going on.  A toaster?  At 5.49 for the combo I'm feeling a little eater's remorse right now.  I could have had an espresso and a muffin at Cartel for that.  Dammit.  I hate myself.  I'm getting fat too.  ;(	2
	1906	I hiked the Gateway Loop Trail, which is 4.6 miles total.  It was a Saturday and it was very busy.  The parking lot was packed, but we were able to easily find a parking spot.\n\nBefore you walk in to the trail head, you walk through a welcome center area of sorts.  There's a map of the trails in the preserve with a model to show you where to go.  It also tells you the difficulty levels of the trails so you know what to expect.  That was very cool.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdowell-sonoran-preserve-scottsdale?select=l-PThMUC157rOFrBSibtcw#l-PThMUC157rOFrBSibtcw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdowell-sonoran-preserve-scottsdale?select=11QU2z1pB4YGASeO_elaxA#11QU2z1pB4YGASeO_elaxA\n\nThere were a couple of volunteer guys greeting people and helping them figure out where to go.  If they weren't there, it would've been very confusing to find out where to go.  It's not intuitive.  Despite the models and maps, it's not clearly marked until you walk into the preserve for 1000 ft or so.\n\nOnce we got on the trail, it was pretty cool.  The Gateway Loop Trail has some nice views of the Valley.  Camelback and Mummy Mountains are easily seen.  On the North side of the trail, you can see the Troon and Pinnacle Peak areas.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdowell-sonoran-preserve-scottsdale?select=FylmgvBeS_V7uRaXyxSqJA#FylmgvBeS_V7uRaXyxSqJA\n\nHowever, there wasn't much else to look at.  Except for a lizard, we didn't see any animals or wildlife.  We heard a few birds squawking to warn each other that people were nearby, but we didn't see them.  It gets kind of boring if you don't have anything to look at on a trail.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdowell-sonoran-preserve-scottsdale?select=VUkoLu93oFa1eB4dK8pyhA#VUkoLu93oFa1eB4dK8pyhA\n\nOverall, it was an OK hiking experience.  I am accustomed to more scenic hiking trails, so I was a bit bored after a while.  The number of mountain bikers on the trail annoyed me.....they're so dangerous for hikers, I don't like them.\n\nI'm planning to hike the Lost Dog Trail this week.  Let's see how that goes.\n\nReturn Factor - 80%	2
	1907	After many disappointing so-so meals in Las Vegas, we stumbled into Olives at the Belligio. WOW!!! So glad we did. We actually had reservations at Fix, but when we say the menu at Olives we asked if we could have dinner there instead. They were booked, but we could sit at the bar (two empty spaces magically appeared). We grabbed them and Olives said they would cancel our other reservations for us (thank you!). Again - WOW. My friend had the special sea bass (YUMMY) and I had the pork tenderloin...oooh yes. Sooo good. The servers were outstanding too. They had a great patio to see the water show, but reservation are definited needed for that. Will be coming back next time and recommending to everyone.	4
	1908	Environment - Sleek chic with a comfortable undertone.  Great music playing at the right level, perfect lighting, comfy and tactically agreeable spacing and seating .\n\nService - Jarrett was our server and he was fantastic.  Extremely personable, knowledgeable and really in sync with the menu and the establishment.   Especially astonishing given the fact that this place has been open for less than two weeks.  \n\nFood - One large pizza, half Grilled Chicken Farm Goat and half Cheese Basil Chicken Sausage.  Soggy crust, bland sauce and unremarkable.\n\nDrink - A port wine and almond soda concoction, the name escapes me (as I think I intentionally erased it from my memory) that tasted vaguely like a Hi-C drink.\n\nBeing a native of both New York City & Boston I check my finicky East Coast pizza munching history at the door when I know I'm about to order a West Coast Artisan Pizza.  But even by those standards the pizza was a fail.  Unfortunately we weren't hungry enough to order some of the things Jarrett suggested and the salads & wings (from afar) looked great.  My drink choice was also a fail, especially considering how many wonderful craft beers I had to choose from.\n\nPizza Lounge is supposed to start a Happy Hour next week and I'll be back there when they do.  I need to sample more of what they have and find a taste bud pop since everything else was so great.	2
	1909	Decent cocktail and wine menu but like most of the stiffs in this place, they are trying a little too hard.  Just the fact that some idiot took a picture of an exotic sports car in the parking lot says it all (pic #11).\n\nThey try to have the neighborhood vibe and to be inviting but none of my neighbors want to pay $18 for a plate of average pasta.  \n\nDon't wear a plaid shirt with jeans or else people will look at you like you're part of the waitstaff.	1
	1910	Service is great! I don't really care for the atmosphere because I prefer quieter, more relaxed places, but to get the party started at Marquee, this is perfect. \n\nIt is very expensive, but I would expect that on the strip, and especially at Cosmo. The food you get, while small quantities, is delicious and the presentation is beautiful. I sat in the middle area one time and watched them pick out garnishes very precisely with tweezers. The dessert seems very interesting- I've only had the hazelnut something /salted caramel dish and it was divine. But I'm curious about the other desserts!\n\nWe've had the same server 3 times, and she's fantastic, I wish I'd caught her name. The drinks have all been perfect. I love the mojito, and there's another drink I just tried but I forget the name- it had cucumber water, and a berry type floater. It was delicious!	3
	1911	There ain't much for vegetarians here. Fortunately I eat fish, but if didn't, I suppose I could have had... what, a salad? Of course I can get a salad anywhere, so that ain't sayin' much. The food was pretty good, nothing mind-blowing but not bad by any means. My group snacked on a variety of appetizers - ahi tacos, carne tacos and quesadillas. Ahi tacos were pretty tasty, and contained quite the generous helping of ahi. About the size of a chicken breast, actually. Quite impressive. I don't eat meat, so I didn't try the carne tacos, but my friends said they were pretty good. And the quesadillas, well, they were pretty good too, but not enough cheese to qualify as quesadillas in my opinion. My biggest problem with this place, aside from from the lackluster service, was the lack of veggie options. I mean, come on people, almost every other Mexican restaurant in the  valley at least has mushroom or spinach enchiladas on the menu. Would it kill you to put something on a plate you didn't have to kill? Not judging, just saying..	2
	1912	This is a great little place! I used to go here all the time when I lived up in North Scottsdale for happy hour but I found myself here last night and remembered how much I liked it. I had the pad Thai with beef and it was really good. You can choose your level (scale of 1 to 5) of spiciness which is nice. I'm sort of a wuss when it comes to spicy food. I like it but my palette is a bit sensitive so I went with a 2 and it was just spicy enough to give you that extra kick without having to chug 3 glasses of water...I only needed one! Just kidding; no water needed; it was great! :-)	3
	1913	We stayed here on a Saturday night in December. My Mothers Christmas Party was being held here. We arrived to check in around 4pm with a very long line to check in. Once we got to the counter they seemed very confused but we did finally get into our room. The elevator to get to your room is a pain because you have to slide your key it requires the elevator ride to be a experience. I encountered many people who were drunk later that night that had a terrible time going up and down trying to get to their floor. Once we arrived to the room  the size was nice enough but the smell was HORRIBLE. I dont know if it was people in the rooms next to us or rotten water but it just wasn't a pleasant place to stay in. I was really wishing I had air freshener. The decor in the rooms is really nice but I am not sure what was going on with the smell of the place. I would stay there again but only if we got another deal because I had a hard time finding good places to get a quick bite to eat and like I said earlier the elevators are a PAIN.	1
	1914	Eggspectations offre des d\u00e9jeuner et Brunch classics \u00e0 un prix raisonnable :  Choix parmis des oeufs, des crepes, des fruits, du the/cafe, jus de fruits, saucisses, bacon et autres mets classics ! Je n'en dis pas plus, le go\u00fbt est moyen, le service est acceptable. J'y retournerais peut \u00eatre mais comme il y tant de restaurant qui offre un d\u00e9jeuner et un brunch \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, je voudrais surement passer mon temps et d\u00e9penser mon argent pour d\u00e9couvrir d'autres endroits plus interessant !	1
	1915	I actually went here over a month ago but felt it worthy of saving for my 200th review.  If it wasn't for Yelp I this is one of the places I have eaten I never would have known about.  And it is sort of fun to tell your date your are going to eat in a mostly vacated strip mall just off the highway. :-)  I had been here previously for a Yelp event.\n\nWe arrived around 6 on a Saturday just as it was getting dark.  We got seated right away.  Even at that early hour the place was far from empty.  It seldom happens we are amongst the youngest folks in any venue so we happily take note.  As the evening went on the crowd got younger and the place was almost packed.\n\nWe got our waters and menus right away and then we sort of got forgotten for about 5 minutes or so before our waiter introduced himself and took our drink orders.  That would prove to be the only glitch in food or service the entire meal.  I had the PCG pasta and she had a black and blue burger.  I also had a salad with Blue cheese dressing.  Lately we seem to have been on a run of less than stellar blue cheese, both my dressing and the crumbles on her burger were good.  We both enjoyed our meal.  Usually we try some of each others food but I declined to take a bite of a well done burger, however she thought it was great.  I did sample the fries and they were pretty good.  The beer selection had a couple of selections I liked to choose from.\n\nExcellent place for a nice dinner out.  Even if you get in to steaks the place is not over the top expensive.  It was quiet enough we no trouble talking.	3
	1916	Horrible. Poor service and bad food. Don't waste your time and money. This is my first Yelp review, and I usually don't complain. You know how bad it is.	0
	1917	The Forrest Cafe is unique. Situated (surprisingly) off Forrest Road, on Bristo Place (Bristo Cafe wouldn't have the same ring to it) it is entirely unlike any other business near-by. Expect dread-locks, harem pants and artists; the forest cafe is part cafe, part art exhibit and part meeting point for hippies. \n\nImmediately inside the door is a small gallery, in which anyone can arrange to demonstrate their work. Past the exhibit is the main room- covered in graffiti, painting and miss-matched furniture- where food and drinks are served. The food is cheap and reasonably tasty, though not exceptional. My nachos were pretty good, costing \u00a33. Although non-alcoholic drinks are served, you may also bring your own booze, making the Forest Cafe a cheap option for a night out. The staff are friendly, in fact most are volunteers who choose to work to earn their keep in the rooms above.\n\nAt night bands play on a stage in the main room and the place livens up. Worth a visit if only to see some of the weird and wonderful clientele, don't feel intimidated by the piercings; grab a bongo and get involved!	2
	1918	The reason for the one star is simply due to the attitude and service of the people that work here. Rude on the call in order, rude when picking up and not a thank you in sight. No offering of napkins, choice of dressing on a salad or utensils. With all the choices in Vegas, the owner had better have a talk with the employees. I will go elsewhere.	0
	1919	Not sure how this place got such high marks. I ordered a 2 meat combo, bulgogi and spicy chicken. It was so salty it was not edible, I asked them for a replacement as I assumed it was a one time issue with the plate. Second plate came out and same thing. Not sure i understand how a korean restaurant can screw up the most basic of meals. Avoid..	0
	1920	Wow - such a great place!  We came in Saturday night for dinner and had a great experience.  The atmosphere is great - love the lighting and decor, the service is so professional and the food was fantastic.  I enjoyed the wedge salad, a delmonico steak, the mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts.  I only wish I had left room to indulge in a red velvet bread pudding...next time for sure!	3
	1921	The concept is great, Karma Pizza is good, nothing exceptional. Boba tea is not something I would recommend, I tried lychee with lychee jelly and it was watery and then I tried the milk tea ( and they has ran out of boba) and offered rainbow jelly and I accepted. Such a horrible suggestion, rainbow jelly is tangy and acid and milk tea is sweet and creamy. It was huge and very expensive :(	1
	1922	Good Steaks but no atmosphere. It's a cross between somewhere trying to create a 'scene' and the Outback Steakhouse.\nLaminated menus and explanations of what 'medium-rare' is kinda says it all for me.	1
	1923	I've been here three times, and each time was just excellent. A clean, professional salon.\n\nThe massages are lovely: the rooms are comfortable and relaxing, and each person I've had has been just great. Their hand and wrist massages can't be beat.\n\nThe pedicures are great: my experiences have been a little rough and tumble, but they sure make my feet look amazing. The manicures lasted for over a week, and were fast and lovely. \n\nI also had my hair cut and colored here, and it turned out stellar. Professional, friendly service with a great cut and amazing highlights. The stylist took my concerns about my hair (lightening without damaging) seriously and worked within serious constraints very well.\n\nMy only cons:\nSome of the rooms can be a little cold. Also, my manicurist went MIA when I was in the nail dryer and I had to find another manicurist to fix one of my nails. Other than that, and the rough handling of feet during the pedicure, all my experiences here have been top notch.	3
	1924	Excellent service and friendly people who work there. Just very expensive and they recommend testing on just about everything. My other vet, who retired, would look at my pets and their symptoms and write them a perscription. They always recovered. This vet is good but has to test for everything which doubles or triples the the cost of the treatment. I'll probably use this service when I have to or until I find a cheaper good vet.	2
	1925	"I have been in some dumps before but this one was takes the cake! The only good thing is they allow \""pets\"". Did a couple prisoner watch details in here for a federal contract. Great for me ; ) Next day, brought my German Shepard in. This place has gotta be a trucker's nightmare. A dump. Roaches, ticks or bedbugs, hair in the sheets and cigarette burns all over the furniture and bathroom sink / toilet cover. Very hard for anyone to sleep soundly as you hear big rigs coming and going all the time plus the usual prostitutes or \""lot lizards\"". Tweekers run amok at night so lock your stuff up securely."	0
	1926	So the food was decent, the service was absolutely terrible and I was charged for a soda when all I got was carbonated water... I asked why and the poor waiter said that when they don't charge for it, the owner takes it out of their check.. Are you kidding me? Not like I needed 2 dollars, and not like it was a big deal but it was when the waiter told me about the owner. I will never be back and don't recommend. It looks like they are struggling anyways so good luck attempting to obtain clients with the way you practice  your business and treat your employees. If you are the owner, and you want to reach out to me and talk about it let me know. I'd love to give you a piece of my mind.	0
	1927	Starting to feel a little less generous about my rating for Lotus.\n\nThe last few trips have been sub par compared to my first two. Waiters have been less attentive and rarely return to check up on your meal unless they are hurrying you to finish your meal so they can turnover the table. Food has been arriving to the table lukewarm and under or overcooked. Portions are even getting smaller.\n\nI'm kind of embarrassed because I highly recommended this restaurant to my friends visiting and they were less than impressed. The only constant is the mango sticky rice. \n\nNot exactly planning my next trip back anytime soon...	2
	1928	Goto spot for my late night poker session refueling. \n\nMy go to dish is the Chicken PadThai. Big portions and fresh. \nLemongrass always gets my comps and always will. \n\n\nProps to Aria for having great food selection for casino/poker room players.	3
	1929	Extremely over rated restaurant the food is very bland. You can open any bag of lettuce and dress it poorly to get the same result. The service was terrible. The waitresses are rude and once they take your order you will never see them again \n\nWhen I asked what was recommended the waitress was completely put out. When i asked for a four top in the main dining room the miserable idiot they hired for a hostess could not have been less gracious., she wanted to put us in the back shitty add on when the main dining room was 1/2 full  Their style is pure 70's shabby chic gone stale. The food cannot amaze anyone unless you have been living on hospital food. Do not waste your time and money. This place has jumped the shark.	1
	1930	Quite possibly one of the worst food experiences of my life, Mexican or Salvadorean. At one point, this space was a Salvadorean-Mexican fusion place owned by the same people as the Las Palmas market next door. The BF was one of their biggest fans.\n\nBut we went a couple of weeks ago, and despite being the same type of food, and the same space, this was not the restaurant he remembered. \n\nFor the life of me I can't even remember what we ordered, only how awful it was. I vaguely recall ordering enchiladas but receiving something that did not even remotely resemble the dish. The corn tortillas were the only redeeming factor, but the meat inside was overcooked to the point of being dry, tasteless, crunch. The rice and beans looked suspicious and tasted worse- I don't think I've seen beans that far gone outside of a dumpster. The complimentary chips were stale. The salsa was watery. The food looked and tasted, in short, very old.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 is small and simple, d\u00e9cor next to nonexistent, and the service is just as minimal. And I don't mean that in a good way.	1
	1931	Nice little comic shop.. I only read a few different comics, so I'm not sure what kind of selection they really have, but it seemed extensive. They definitely carried the ones I was looking for, at least. They have a small children's rack, and a (sadly small) selection of manga. They have filing cabinets that appear to be chock full of back issues of older comics, at least from the comments I overheard. They also have a nice selection of magic decks, some d&d books, and other games, as well as lots of collectible toys. \nDefinitely will be back to this location.	3
	1932	Always CLEAN and PLENTY of room to EAT-IN. PLUS they always remember your face even though they may not speak english they KNOW what you want. The murals all over are very soothing TOO\nConsistent. Always the same thing. Burgers & Fries are REALLY good. Tacos are good, NOT very spicy though, red & green sauce are a little mild. They do not grill the tortillas. Which is good if you don't like the mess BUT if you like them flavorful you WANT grilled tortillas\nA MEDIOCRE MEXICAN TACO STAND A real nice lunch spot. If you only have 30 minutes and you just wanna get full this is good for you. YOU need to special order here and tell them to add chileS to everything to spice it up but the MEATS are very tender & good NOT that OTHER stuff. If you want a GOOD fast food burger try one and the fries are ALWAYS fresh. EVERY thing is MADE TO ORDER	2
	1933	Good if you have a wing craving although the wings could be meatier. Extensive sauce choices but limited menu otherwise. Long waits between ordering and tray pick-up at the name calling window.\n\nOverall, the wings should be better for a wing-focused joint.	1
	1934	"The food is good. I've probably eaten here five times in the past month. Its priced very reasonably. The thai basil and Evil Jungle Princess are great. A few complaints I have: there's a waiter whose name I don't know, but he wears glasses and is always there-  he has awkwardly stared at me for long periods of time while I was eating. Enough that its made me uncomfortable. I don't really like getting stared at while eating. Also, they have a dish called \""Garlic Lover\"" that should be renamed \""Black Pepper Lover\"". Both times I ordered it, there was visibly too much black pepper and I could feel it crunching in my teeth as I ate my food. It really ruins what would otherwise be a good dish. But other than that, the place is fine. I'll keep coming here."	3
	1935	Parking is terrible and location hidden in the corner. It gets better from there. Variety of food good. Fresh and good quality. Good portions are served and price is good for quality and quantity. Atmosphere is old deli style that everyone wants to be at. Food is good service is good. Worthy of repeats.	3
	1936	RIP. This place has been closed for a long long time. To bad, it was good times.	0
	1937	"The food was so so. What I didn't like was being served lunch special fried rolls that were called spring rolls on the appetizer menu for $2.95. Not at all the cold wrapped spring rolls I have had everywhere else. Seemed like a trap to buy more expensive \""fresh rolls\"" for $5.95. When I tried to send them back. She said you have to exchange them for fresh rolls. I begrudgingly left a tip I didn't want to."	0
	1938	I hope nobody reads this cuz I don't want to wait 3 hours instead of 2. This is my favorite restaurant. I can eat here every other day.  Please open one in Dallas!\n\nBtw I don't think this restaurant is owned by Asians cuz the service is pretty friendly good ... I kid.	4
	1939	Slow service with an attitude and emo in the background. Rather expensive and very snooty. Kid at the register was blatantly inattentive and had mumbled responses to questions. Waited a long time to order, longer for a coffee and even long for a Tuna Melt (+ 40 minutes). Will not be coming here again. Would rather walk the few extra blocks to one of the other cafes nearby with better service.	1
	1940	"When I was 8 years old I was told by my father many things that always made sense to me. Things that stay with me for ages. Shaped who I am. Things like...never buy ducks from man in a hat, or punch anyone in throat who looks at you cross eyed...because of that one I was thrown out of Catholic Boarding school...to be fair...that nun had it coming. He also said to me this...whenever you can buy small plates of food...do it, you can really throw those plates much more accurately when you are mad.  So wise. So wise. Again, because of that one I spent 11 months in a Basque prison. Oh well, I learned how to stamp on grapes and make wine and say \""abajo con los cerdos espanol.\"" Overall not too bad.\n\nSo when I heard that the beloved FireFly was taking over the horrible restaurant in the Plaza I was thrilled. So happy that I put down my bottle of keyboard cleaner and my rag, stood up, fell down, and stood up again. I waved my weak and jittery arm. The people in the bus moved further away.\n\nOh, Spain...you may be fascist oppressors, but you invented a damn good drink...Sangria.  The Sangria here is aged 3 days and it tastes out of this world. It really is as good as you will possibly get for the price (24 bucks for a pitcher that would cost you 100 in a club on the strip).  I had the white wine Sangria. Perfection. Bring your own big straw...they don't provide them. Oh well.\n\nWe tried 10 plates ranging from 4.50 to 9 bucks. Each one better than the last. The civiche was perfect. Lime juice, red onions and shrimp. Perfect.  The fillet minon was expertly cooked.  We had several others, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms were so amazingly good they should have their own large plate...like a platter...delivered to me by supermodels. The  empanadas were rich and perfectly filled. \n\nThe food is great, but the atmosphere is just excellent. It is fun and casual without being too casual. The round glass room, which you will need reservations, is the best at night. See the lights of Downtown and watch the Freemont Street Experience show every half hour. It fits in so perfectly with the whole Downtown revitalization vibe.  \n\nOne star off...the plates, as good as they are could have more on them. They really skimp at times and it makes no sense considering the price tag. Also, the wrong server can blow this experience for you, by being too slow and not knowing the menu. I have had decent servers most times, but once I got a bad one...and believe this...when you hold him down and start pulling out his nose hairs one at a time suddenly YOU'RE the bad guy. This world is so sideways.  Oh well.\n\nRex speaks. You eat. You do if you know what is good for you. Rex doesn't speak twice."	3
	1941	So since we were staying at the HR we decided to get bottle service @ Vanity to celebrate our friend getting married. When we showed up they all got right to work getting our table together with drinks & mixers. The server we had was great she never let our drinks get empty. We had to have security come over a couple of times since there were a few douche bags getting in our area but they took care of them real quick.\nIt was nice that we had such a great spot next to the dance floor.\nWe drank..we danced..we drank some more.\nIt was a perfect night out & all we had to do when we were done at 4am was waddle up to our room & pass out.\nThanks for the good times Vanity!!	4
	1942	Service sucked. Food wasn't bad but not worth the price. Wont be going back soon	1
	1943	"Nice and pretty hotel and casino.\n\nWe didn't stay here, but we visited the casino. It was nice, airy, and smells wonderful. However, the security guard at the front entrance was a jerk. It wasn't a busy night, he stood right at the entrance, we were kinda lost. We asked how to get back to Las Vegas strip without circling around the building and his answered was \""GO OUTSIDE AND WALK ON THE SIDEWALK.\"" Yeah...thanks, Aria. For future trips, I will spend my money elsewhere."	1
	1944	There isn't another place to get great ice cream.  Cold stone is it!  I was supposed to be on a diet and the tantalizing pictures and descriptions of their creations had me walking over here on my lunch break for a cake shake. I ditched my turkey sandwich and gorged on cake batter flavored ice cream. It was soooo worth it. Next time I'm going to make a crazy combination of favors. I'll let y'all know how it goes.	4
	1945	Not worth the trip out of the strip	1
	1946	Chose this place because of the Hilton name.  Stayed here for 12 nights so I believe my review should hold some weight!  We were given a voucher for 2 bottles of complementary water when we arrived.  I told the clerk we were here for 12 days.  She said water only provided the first day.  For a desert facility, you would think that you would be given 2 per day of stay.  Seemed a bit stingy for a 4 star resort.  We were taken to to Bldg. 17, one of the farthest buildings from the main lobby and main pools.  We were in a handicap accessible suite.  First observation, parking is very tight.  Parking under building is prohibited.  From peeking inside one of these slots, you can see netting attached to the ceiling because the building is crumbling!  Outside hallways to back rooms are dark and murky.  Had to call for light bulbs to be changed.  Room seemed reasonably nice, but then!!!  Walk in shower floods entire bathroom.  Maintenance had to rip out drain and clean it out, only to find out that the design of the bowed shower curtain was the cause of the flooding.  For 10 days, had to prop up shower curtain in front of drain with rolled towels!  No shelving except for soap tray for shampoo, etc.  Anyone in a wheelchair or severely disabled would be in real trouble.  Next, the sink is not in the bathroom!!!  You have to go into the bedroom to wash your hands!  Very unsanitary.  Balcony claustrophobic with a limited view because of the building in front of us.  Room was made up in a timely fashion when requested, however, I don't believe the room was vacuumed more than once in 12 days.  How do I know this?  I had to kill a nasty spider in the popcorn ceiling and the remnants littered the floor for days.  I also found a spider in the bed and one lurking on the sheer (dirty) draperies.  The paint on the inside window ledges has been painted so many times, it has a life of its own!  Towels in room are old and rough.  One day we had one that had blue stains all over it.  Coffee and tea in room is nice, but no sink to fill machine.  Water in refrigerator is $3 a bottle and premium water n counter $6.50.  No, thanks!  Bought a case of water at Walgreens for 3.99 and lugged it to the room for the duration.  Went to the Pointe of Tyme Restaurant for dinner that night.  Burger was superb and salmon was delicious.  Pleasantly surpised.  Breakfast good to if you order off the menu.  Breakfast buffet ok.  Wait staff very professional and helpful.  Internet was good, but we had to change codes 3 times during stay.  The pool closest to us had plumbing trucks lined up all week.  Went to the large main pool one day.  Went into the jacuzzi, but it was broken.  The clincher came the last day.  Put the Do Not Distrub sign on door and went to breakfast.  Check out is 11 AM.  Returned at 10:15 AM to find the maid in our room cleaning it out for the next guest!!!  We had already taken our luggage to our car, but all of our sundry possessions were still in the room.  My husband's kindle was unplugged and in a bag on the housekeeping cart.  Our precious water was whisked away and room was in disarray from the cleaning in progress.  If we had come a few minutes later, we would have had to track down our things!  So in summary, this place, on the surface looks great.  The lobby, the entrance grounds, and restaurants are all beautiful.  The rooms:  Yuk!  Service:  depends - hot and cold.  Pools:  All need work.  My advice:  Wait until after they bulldoze the buildings before staying here!	1
	1947	The prime rib was excellent and, to literally top it off, I ordered foie gras to complement the fantastic steak. Great ambience, great service, overall a great dining experience.	3
	1948	I have recently re-joined Monkey Bar after several years away.  When I first joined, I went through nothing less than a transformation during the 60-day challenge.  I thought that I could keep it up on my own, but let's face it, some people thrive on peer pressure and just being told what to do.  The price tag may seem steep, but it is on par with Crossfit gyms, and bootcamps that other gyms offer.  The value is in the instruction.  Jon and Jess, (and Olivia, Kevin, Polly, Robyn, Sean) are knowledgeable, motivating, encouraging wonderful people.  I also really like the strong fundamentals from Eischen's yoga that translate directly into the lifts that we do.  So, if you like class-driven workouts, high intensity interval training, and enjoy pushing yourself as hard as the person across the room that you are secretly competing with, this is for you.	4
	1949	I havent been in here for many years and it feels like the place has changed massively. The selction of ales is impressive and their main line spirts/beers are interesting enough, but thats where it ends. \n\nI remember the bar being quite different and a bit old worldy in design. Example being I am sure they used to have book shelves with old books and now they have wall paper with books on instead. It kind of felt like being in an airport bar when everyones flight is delayed. The menu looked like standard pub fair and looked really nice when it was being served up. I am not going to use the phrase gastro pub as everywhere seems to be a gastro pub these day and the bar has been raised on that. The place was busy but the staff seemed bored and a little disinterested with proceedings. Dont think I would refuse to go there, but I wouldnt be rushing back considering the number of great places around.	1
	1950	This place is AMAZING! Not only do they have great food but INCREDIBLE customer service! I made a reservation for 11 people and as soon as we walked in we were seated right away, not all of our party came in at the same time but we were still seated. Some places u have to wait until your party arrives. Food came to our table so quick! They were all very attentive, empty plates were taken as soon as it's cleared, they asked if there's anything we would like to order. This is WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. Very impressed! Scott remembered us from our previous visit and that's very rare. Price is very reasonable. By far the best AYCE Sushi in town! And I'm very impressed with decor, atmosphere, and they played good upbeat music! Very modern!	4
	1951	The light rail is pretty convenient and the stops for the train are pretty well planned\nIt gets busy during the day due to all the college students and people getting to and fro work\nAt night it can be pretty sketchy but there are several security officers who hop on and off the train to ensure safety as well as check to make sure everyone purchased a ticket... \nThis particular stop is a great place to hop on or off if you are trying to get to the main part of the ASU main campus\nAlso, I feel pretty safe at this station because it is near the hub of Tempe Police	2
	1952	Crispy fried chicken with Biscuits and sides like red beans and rice. A tasty quick meal with a little bit of southern flare. My husband loves this place, and could eat chicken daily. As for me, I enjoy the chicken, especially when it's spicy like this place. \n\nFor quick meal pick up, this place is the good choice.	2
	1953	The main cook knows my order by heart, some of the counter staff know it as well. I always get it cause its always awesome, steak burrito with WHITE CHEESE beans rice and pico  all inside. Its very important you say white, its way better in my opinion than the yellow. The beans are always warm and the rice is always soft, the steak is always good. Pico is pico so lets not go overboard here. This beast costs me around 6 bucks but its always worth it!\n\nBut how do you make this place even better? Now they have a loyalty card program at this location!!! Every $50 you spend get a free meal(usually burrito and can of soda). Thats awesome, i usually come 3 times a week anyways, but now theyre making it more worth it!  Its open 24 7 and always consistently quality. Some cooks make better(bigger) burritos then others but thats everywhere.  Only thing that really matters is they all taste delicious...	4
	1954	"First off, I love In-N-Out so that's my baseline.  This is more of an experience restaurant than a good burger joint.  The burger was a little dry, and the fries were great for my first serving but soggy for the second.  But it's the atmosphere.  Our server was great- not super hot, but cute.  But very professional, stayed in her \""role\"" for the expeience as our nurse and she took care of us.  I only got a single but was amazed at this girl across from us who must have weight a buck-o-five and she downed a double.  when she came in she was all cheerful but when she was done eating she looked all haggard... I guess that's a good thing."	2
	1955	This has to be the worst Mexican food in Las Vegas!!!  I ordered the Chimichanga with Chili Colorado.  It was 95% canned refried beans and 5% meat.  It was topped with 1 black olive and a gigantic glob of sour cream, making it a soggy mess.  The chips were like styrofoam, and the salsa tasted like something from the generic section of Walmart.  The best part of the meal was the ice water.  The slop they serve at Taco Bell and Robertos is far superior to this place.  Other reviews talk about the Margaritas- if I had had enough of these, I might not care about the food here.  The only positive was the waitress, who was very nice and attentive.	0
	1956	It's in the Chinese Cultural Center so we thought it would be more authentic.  The sweet and sour pork, shrimp with lobster sauce, eggplant with garlic sauce, and steamed dumplings were all just OK.  The fried pork chops were way overcooked and dry.\n\nI overheard the waiter tell a Chinese family that they don't serve sauteed shrimps since the shrimps aren't fresh -- being in Arizona, not by the sea.  At least he was honest with the customer.\n\nTip: If you want the steamed dumplings, order them while you peruse the menu.  We ordered ours with the rest of the food and the dumplings were the last to arrive at the table.  We were full already by the time it came.	1
	1957	Pretty good sandwiches. The Holiday turkey is by far the best, and it's on the menu all year!!! I decided to try something new and ordered the chipotle chicken this trip and it was whatever. This is a good place to stop and get a quick meal before going out when you're in Vegas. Solid 4 stars for the holiday turkey, one star off for the 45 minute line.\n\n****IMPORTANT NOTE**** \nMy recommendation is to go to the OTHER EARLS LOCATION on the strip, as the line at this one is RIDICULOUS. That one is WAYYYY less busy since most people don't know it exists	2
	1958	The food was good but nothing to blow your mind.  The portions were huge, all of us ended up getting a doggy bag (and I'm a fatty so that's saying something).  I would check it out if you are in the neighborhood!  Prices ranged from $9-22, so you could eat for cheap if you wanted.	2
	1959	this Starbucks really care for customers service. I really hate myself for not remembering my barista name. they greet you as you walk in. if your a regular they greet not only by your name, but they know what you want already. they work on it so you can enjoy your lattes, frap, espresso, etc... right away. I love coming here at night to hang out, until their closed. if it does get hot the mist outside helps with the heat.	3
	1960	Food was good till you go in the restroom. Terrible sewer smell and the next day stomach was not very happy!	0
	1961	While their prices are good, the low cost is reflected in the quality of service. \n\nThey did a good job on my pants but PINNED their tracking label through the cuff of BOTH my dress shirts. $80 shirts with a NEEDLESS hole in the cuff now. When an attempt was made at discussing this with them, the manager pointed out how one of the shirts was 'already pretty worn' and so they wouldn't do anything.\n\nI can not recommend using them anymore, as having needless damage done for the sake of their convenience is unacceptable.	1
	1962	My husband I stayed at the Phoenician for my birthday and the hotel is overall beyond exceptional . I am really disappointed I didn't give J&G a chance (it took 30 minutes just to greet us to order a drink and terrazzo was our second choice.)Il Terrazzos setting is exquisitely romantic , the wine list is better than J&G. I started out with the Potato Chowder , the presentation was fun and the soup was really good. My husband had a caesar, the dressing had the perfect lemon touch, I liked it, but my husband thought it was too salty. We both ordered filets and like they say don't order steak at an Italian Restaurant ;not true, but in this case it was one of the worse steaks I've had. I ordered mine medium and my husband medium rare. The steaks didn't come out as requested, I nibbled on mine but it was too dry to finish and my husband returned his because it was well done. When he cut into the replacement steak there was no jus at all, both of are steaks so dry it wasn't easy to cut through , you just wanted a pound of sauce for moisture. Disappointing for a 42.00 steak and 150.00 check for a disappointing meal. the waiter was really great and made our experience pleasant and we tipped well even though the food was horrible. I think he felt bad and he sent complementary  goat cheese cake and a chocolate torte wine champagne to our room. It was a great way to end the night .. I don't think I will revisit the restaurant, but I do hope they get take a hint and improve the quality.	1
	1963	I have been goi g to Love a Pup for a year and left because of the uneven shave on my dogs, then I went back after taking my other dogs there for anal gland cleaning, well we took our fog in Saturday and she once again was uneven took my other dog into day and it was horrific what they did to her, then the owner Tiffany yelled at me telling me I'm never happy and then looked at my dog and said ya your right it's uneven after telling me it wasn't then on top of it they violated me dog by shaving her head to tail which they took that off too it was a Poole cut short and she looks horrible!!! I told Tiffany the owner that I pay a lot of money here she rolled her eyes and shook her head no and said no you don't. Well that's for sure I'm not going to be paying them any more Your Fired Love a Pup!!! Look at the horrible job they did which she was right on one thing she was confused I would never ask for this to happen to my dog!! So no stars for you Tiffany owner of LOVE A PUP	0
	1964	Just awful. Terrible room. Beat up furniture. Dirty carpet.  Terrible room. Despite being a non smoking room it smelled of cigarettes.  Font desk gave incorrect check in and room change information.  I will never stay here again.	0
	1965	I really want to like Emeril's food...I really do like the charismatic S.O.B....but this is my third restaurant of his and again I walked out unimpressed. Went for lunch, ordered the most expensive thing on the menu...lobter thermedor...and I ended up with a $40 dish...for lunch mind you..with hardly any lobster, any flavor, and a very unpleasant doughy substance  that I believe was supposed to be the expected flaky pastry that covers the dish but was just plopped unceremoniously into the flavorless muddle of ingredients. The place was dead too, but most of the places in the casinos that do even open for lunch and are considered higher end are dead...obviously this is one that doesnt seem to care about the few that do show up.	1
	1966	Came for steak night on Saturday. It's only 15.99 with players card and the selection is amazing.   Steaks available are NY strip, bacon wrapped filet, prime rib, rib eye, and carne asada. There are several sushi choices as well. The tamales are good and there are a ton of sides and veggies to choose from. Glad we stopped by.	4
	1967	I freaking love Taco Bell. \n\nEvery time a cheesy gordita crunch is in my presence, I bust out the kleenex and vaseline.\n\nTHANK GOD FOR TACO BELL!	4
	1968	Interior looks sad and outdated, fitting the theme of the casino it's located in.  Ordered the surf & turf, which is the filet and lobster.  All entrees come with a trip to the soup and salad bar, so got a few vegetables and the clam chowder.  Soup was really gritty, they should try to wash the clams out better.  When the food came, it was pretty obvious that the steak I got was previously frozen, as the texture was dry although cooked medium rare.  I'm pretty sure the steak I got was only USDA Choice or Select, the types you can get in any supermarket.  For the price, you'd really expect that it would be Prime.  Also, the lobster while large was rubbery and tough, not like fresh juicy lobster which I also expected.  I can imagine the field day Robert Irvine or Gordon Ramsey would have with this place on their tv shows.  Its only saving grace was the service, as Oscar my waiter was attentive, fast and really friendly.	1
	1969	This is the only applemac supplier in Edinburgh - which always baffles me! It's Scotlands capital and it doesn't have an Apple shop?? Get on it Apple!\n\nAs such, it has everything you want from an apple shop for the same price. You really can't fault the quality - apple are miles ahead of everyone else.\n\nSo I should probably explain myself...\n\nI came in here with a broken laptop - as I have done twice before - I got the new guy. The new guy 'accidently' wiped my harddrive. To me, that's unforgivable.\n\nAs I had been in a few times with my broken laptop I assumed it would be safe! After they broke the news, they then told me it had to be sent away FOR TWO WEEKS to be fixed. Three weeks later, I got my laptop back. Yeah ok it had all the latest software and everything was up-to-date, but it wasn't my laptop. I lost all my photos, my music, my documents, everything! The frustrating thing is it could have been avoided, it was an accident. Thus, I will never forgive you Cancom.	0
	1970	Joey's is a fun place to stop and grab a Chicago Red Hot, and the prices are really sweet!\n\nLike most Chicago places here in the Valley, Joey's has quite a bit of visual stuff going on when you enter the store.  Pictures of the Chicago River, etc.  The fake ivy and brick wall (photo) near where you order is a nice nod towards the Cubies.  If you are from the Southside though, you might not like it as much.  Oh, well!\n\nI also really like the texts (so signup!) offering discounts during football season when the Bears win a game.  Nice!  The only drawback is the location off I-17 and Happy Valley.  It can be a little bit of a schlep from the east valley.  But, the food is good and well worth the trip in our opinion!  So, if you are up at the outlets in Anthem, this might be a stop on the way back.  Hint, hint!\n\nEnjoy!	2
	1971	"Cake review only.\n\nI heard that a birthday party was being thrown in my honor. With cake. Seeing as how I was the local and my parents weren't, I helped to research some places on Yelp. We wound up going for a 6-inch tiramisu cake ($30) from Layers Bakery Cafe.\n\nI haven't much experience with cake orders, and this was my first cake order in the Las Vegas area, but the service seemed solid. I actually left a voicemail message in the evening and they called me back in the morning. They were also nice enough to call on the day of pickup to remind me of the cake and to mention that they'd be there until 4:30pm, even though their official closing time is 4:00pm (I happened to arrive at 4:00pm on the dot). They also offered free candles, twice in fact. I accepted the second time.\n\nIf I'm being really honest, the cake itself was not the best tiramisu that I've had. The coffee flavor was definitely present in the ladyfingers, but there was an almost distracting sweetness from the thick layer of cream that made up about half the cake and from the chocolate shavings and \""shards\"" that were used instead of cocoa. It still tasted delicious to me, as I am a lover of sweet things, but it wasn't that true to tiramisu as I know it.\n\nI have no idea if the other cakes have such a large creamy top layer, but if you're looking for a tiramisu in particular, know what you're getting into. Oh, and the price is probably higher than average due to the sourcing and preparation associated with the \""organic\"" label that they proudly advertise. It is not something that I personally care about.\n\nI really wanted to like Layers Bakery Cafe. The 3-star rating is because, for cake, I'll probably check out other places if I should find myself in need in the future. Can't really call myself a fan if that's how I feel, can I? For the food or baked goods, however, I might give them other visit."	2
	1972	"Usually stop in on Saturday night for a few drinks and apps and always treated great by the crew that works on those nights. Decided to stop in this past Wednesday night late and boy what a difference and not in a good way. Sat at one of the tables close to the bar and a server usually takes care of that area. Sat and waited. Bartender finally yells out at us \""what yA want to drink\"". I asked if the server was going to come to the table and got a reaction like I was stupid for asking that \""we don't have servers you have to come to the bar\"". Really? You do other nights. The table is about 3 feet from the bar and I had to get up to get everything drinks, food, bill. Asked for a coors light draft that I never got. Table we were sitting at had dirty dishes on it that looked like it had been sitting there for a few hours had to move it to the side. No offer for them to be removed for us. Just wanted to eat and go at this point. Left in about 20 minutes when on my regular nights I stay for a few hours and have a couple rounds. Guess will have to stick to Saturday nights"	1
	1973	Service at bakery checkout is terrible,  very rude and slow service.	0
	1974	"As a foodie who grew up in Kansas City, my great frustration with the Las Vegas food scene for many years was the absence of authentic wood-smoked barbecue.  The dirty little secret of the BBQ business is that a lot of it isn't smoked, but just baked in a regular oven.  Oven-baking is a zillion times easier - no fire to tend, no smoke burning your eyes - but it lacks the delicious smokeyness that BBQ fanatics live for.  You will never see a wisp of smoke coming out of Famous Dave's, Lucille's, or Memphis Championship.  But if you drive up to Rollin' Smoke, you'll see the smokers billowing away right in their parking lot.  Rollin' Smoke, Top Notch (both relatively new) and Annie's Kitchen (open for a while now, but not in the best neighborhood) are the only three BBQ joints in Las Vegas where they actually smoke the meat.  And believe me, once you've tasted the difference, you'll never go to the oven-baked frauds again.\n\nFor BBQ lovers who must know:  hickory is the wood of choice at Rollin' Smoke, the dry rub is fairly mild, and their sauce is closest to the sweet Memphis variety.  If you're not that concerned with the fine-print details, suffice it to say that Rollin' Smoke is exactly what barbecue should be:  smokey, meaty, and falling-off-the-bone tender.  If you're looking for a LOT of meat for a terrific price, go with the St. Louis ribs, the $12 half rack feeds two normal adults or one BBQ glutton.  The $20 full rack should easily feed a family of four; the size of the rack is straight out of The Flintstones.  While most people prefer babybacks because of their tenderness, my problem with babybacks is that there just isn't enough meat on them.  My eyes popped when I saw the babybacks at Rollin' Smoke because I've never seen babybacks anywhere (well OK, not in Kansas City, Memphis or Texas - 3 of the 4 \""capitals\"" of BBQ) with so much meat on the bones - all the tenderness of babybacks but twice as much meat.\n\nThere are plenty of other great items on the menu.  The pulled pork and beef brisket are both winners.  For lovers of Texas-style, they even offer beef ribs, done to perfection (beef ribs are a lot trickier than the pork kind).  My favorite side dish is the bacon potato salad.  The mac & cheese is great too.  One side to avoid is the yams, which I thought were blechy.  True to the owner's roots, two Southern classics are available for dessert:  banana pudding and peach cobbler.  They also serve up a blackberry cobbler which is pretty good (even though I don't like blackberries).  Two caveats before you eat here: 1) be very specific about what you're ordering, because mixups can happen; and 2) order less than you think you can eat, because the portions are huge.  If you're looking for food late on a Fri or Sat night, Rollin' Smoke is open until 1:30 a.m. - a far better option than the overpriced mediocrity of casino coffeeshops.\n\nThe typical BBQ joint is formica tables and white plaster walls, bare except for a few pictures of the owner posing with whatever celebrities have eaten there.  Rollin' Smoke is a bit nicer than most because it took over its space from a failed restauranteur whose background was interior design, not food.  But forget the interior, all you need for ambience is a view of those beautiful billowing smokers in the parking lot."	4
	1975	Stopped by this place, it's totally dead.  Machines just eat your money, overpriced hookah that they don't really know how to make.  Totally disappointed at the changes that happen between August and now.  They used to have great hookah, that was well priced and great staff...	0
	1976	"The guys who work here are great.  They are friendly, professional and know their stuff.  Travis, I believe, is the store manager and is very knowledgeable about their merchandise.  I came in to purchase my iphone 6 and my phone arrived more than a week earlier than scheduled.  The transaction was flawless.  They didn't try to \""push\"" me to buy anything else (as others have written).  I'd definitely come back again if I needed to."	3
	1977	"So on a Monday morning on Broughton Street, where to go since our first choice was shut :(  Oh well, save that one for a cheeky mid week cake session!!  \n\nFirst impression it was bright red on the outside but quite neutral on the inside.  \n\nThe lady said she would be with us shortly to take our order, a wee bit of a wait as I was going to go and check out the cakes showing themselves off at the window!  Loads to choose from and the slice is a good potion, thank goodness I was sharing!  I choose for both of us: The \""white chocolate and pear\"" cake.  I could taste the white chocolate but not really much pear.  But it had a nice crumb.\n\nCoffee was a Cappuccino but I like mine stronger and less milky, but it was drinkable and managed with no sugar, which in it's self is a winner.\n\nFor 2 small cappuccinos and a big piece of cake it was reasonable and would come back to grab one of the takeaway sandwiches as they sounded really nice!"	3
	1978	I will NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER Fly this airline again. Customer service is TERRIBLE and there's no such thing as a cheap flight here!	0
	1979	Amazing coaching!  Whether you are a novice or a seasoned athlete you will see results at Crossfit PHX.  I'm not just another member, but rather a part of a community.  I actually know other members by name unlike my old gym!	4
	1980	This place is flawless. It is adorable and the staff are full of energy and charisma. I lov how all their products are natural and guaranteed to never harm your skin or hair. I LOVE coming into the Mandalay Bay and into Lush. I wouldn't go anywhere else for my ocean salt!	4
	1981	This place was fun to go to. They need more places for Mini golf in this town especially outside ones. But, my husband and I had a great time here golfing with all the neon glow in the dark lights and trying to get my ball up Gene Simmons Tongue, taking pictures by the props of KISS and my husband playing video games!!\nIf your a KISS fan you will love this place. Lots of stuff to by and you can even have a Wedding from Hell there or Renew of Vows. \nAlso you have got to use the restroom here. They give you a marker as you go in to write on the WALLS!! How cool is that?\nWe love mini golf and we will be back. They are open 7 days a week from 11am to 12am. I believe its 11.95 a person.	4
	1982	"This place is cool just because of the way that it looks! I really liked the lounge area around the pool. My friends seemed to have a lot of fun that night. We were out celebrating that we finished finals and were all flying home for spring break the next morning. The drinks were pretty good but seemed like it might have been kind of pricey since it's a hotel bar area. It's definitely one of the coolest hotel bars I've been to. Seems like they screen for pretty people and let them in first. Helps to know someone who works there for sure. \n\nSome older guys (like 30's to 40's) got into a mini pushing fight for fun and one dude completely flipped over the couch. They were all too drunk to realize it, but they did do the whole, stand up, arms up \""I'm OK!\"" thing. That was a bit silly"	3
	1983	Quaint coffee joint, my iced latte' was fine, but the barista BANGING metal to metal to dislodge the grinds, gets old very quickly.  There is a better way to do that, and one more conducive to a relaxing environment.	2
	1984	I love me some in n out burger, I live close to this one so it's my main squeeze. The workers here are super nice and friendly. The food for the most part has always been fresh. \nThe reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because dining in one day I saw them pour their cooked fries back into the grease to reheat and worked in a restaurant before that's not a good practice.	3
	1985	So I was trying to be productive tonight, but yet again technology is here to foil my plans. \n\nI was staying at the Cosmopolitan with some friends and we were hungry after lazing by the pool. Yelp pointed us to this scrumptious looking restaurant and once again, it did not disappoint. \n\nWe made reservations on opentable, but they were not needed since it was not busy. After looking at the menu, we went with the Rising Sun and Gold Standard, which seem to be their best burgers according to Yelp reviews. The Yelp reviews also talk about how their milkshakes are excellent, and everyone who was eating seemed to have one of these huge milkshakes. One look at my lactard body started to rebel, so I managed to sum up some willpower and abstain from enjoying one. \n\nSoon after ordering, our appetizers were delicious and made me pretty excited for the rest of our meal. Delicious ahi tuna, rich and creamy lobster macaroni and cheese...I could have stopped there and been happy with my meal. \n\nOur burgers came and although both were pretty good, I liked the Gold Standard better than the Rising Sun. The Rising Sun is covered in this sweet glaze that was okay, but I was really looking for something savory. I'm sure if we didn't have all of the other food, I would have eaten that burger without complaint. \n\nAnother plus is that we asked for our burgers medium-rare and they came medium-rare. Scrumptious! \n\nA third plus is that the table next to us heard me griping to the heavens about paying for wi-fi, so they generously gave me their super secret password to get on. Yay!\n\nA fourth plus was that Kevin Hart was eating at the same time as us, and our server encouraged us to go say hi and take a picture. I had a sudden bout of awkwardness, which tends to happen when I become uncertain. So, I froze awkwardly, stalked around his table like some crazy person, then lost my nerve and fled the scene. \n\nLet's work on that self-confidence, shall we?	3
	1986	Great concept and great results! The Chipotle of pizzas, except better - because only two things cost extra here: a change in crust (to wheat or gluten free) and dairy-free cheese. That's it. Otherwise, for essentially $10, you can get a pizza with any and all toppings they have. All included in the price. It's brilliant.\n\nThe ingredients are quality and the staff is extremely friendly. Instantly a winner. You get to watch your pizza get created from scratch and baked in a brick oven. It comes out nice and toasty for you to consume immediately. The crust comes out pretty well done, and despite putting on a million ingredients, it actually doesn't look overloaded when all is said and done. I would know - I ordered one with literally everything.\n\nHonestly, there is much better pizza out there on the spectrum, but this is a quality pizza for a good price, at a (for me anyway) convenient location. Definitely worth stopping in for this, and the amazing selection and versatility that comes with it.	3
	1987	I don't understand what all the hype is about this place. I have been here and other locations numerous times and it's always so so. The food all tastes the same and the service is never very good. I ordered a simple to go meal today and nothing came out right. It's just chicken tenders people. Plus everytime we have walked in we have been rudely greeted by snooty teenagers...will not be going back anytime soon.	1
	1988	Good food at an amazing price. That being said, they seem to be working out the kinks of a new restaurant, which makes it hard to give it a fourth star. The drinks and appetizers were excellent, but my entree was a real struggle to get through. It was a parsnip cream sauce over excellent fresh pasta, but the parsnip sauce was very bitter and bland. Salt was requested to take the edge off, which apparently is frowned upon since it took maybe 10 minutes for the waiter to bring me a shot glass with a few salt crystals. Food snobbery like this isn't that offensive to me, but when the restaurant doesn't yet have quality control in place to ensure they aren't serving old parsnips, which I am guessing is what happened to those of us unfortunate enough to order the pasta that night, it is really disappointing. All this aside, the space is great, and the quality of the rest of the dishes was enough to make me want to try again.	2
	1989	Ok I have to confess...Roberto's Taco Shop is my weakness...BUT not just any Roberto's...specifically this location because although it is a chain taco shop, for some reason this location on Bermuda and Cactus seems to make it slightly better then the rest.  Here's a few reviews for some of their menu items that are my fave...\n\nThe Carne Asada French Fries is nothing but greasy goodness.  In order for the fries to survive the attack of the guacamole, carne asada, refried beans, sour cream, onions, and tomatoes, you have to ask for the fries to be extra crispy.\n\nThe beef tacos are sinfully good!  They are definitely not stingy with the beef and shredded cheddar cheese.  There is so much in one taco that if taken apart you can make a second taco.\n\nThe golden fried fish in the fish tacos is paired with a tangy coleslaw.  A hint of lemon juice just adds the right touch and you'll find yourself wanting more.  \n\nThe salsa bar is made up of pickled jalapenos, carrots, and onion.  There is also a salsa verde that is just the right heat, regular salsa that is mild, fresh cut radishes and cucumbers, with lemon wedges and cut up lime.  What I like to do is make a cucumber salad with lemon, salt and tapatio...so so good!\n\nThat's it for now...gotta head to Roberto's...!!!	4
	1990	I've mentioned how much I hate getting my oil changed.....I'll mention it again....I hate getting my oil changed. HOWEVER, this experience went pretty smooth.\n\nTheir signature oil service is just under $40 and it includes oil and filter change, checking fluid levels, tire pressure, and vacuuming the interior and washing the external windows. I've been to a Jiffy Lube before, and what I hate is being bombarded with extra stuff I need to fix. This time I was prepared. I know a little something about maintaining my car. Even if it is just a little. \n\nThe guy tried to sell me new windshield wipers....there's nothing wrong with my windshield wipers....how many times does it rain out here anyways??? No thanks. \n\nHe took out the air filter (classic move) to show me how dirty it was. I've learned this move from experience....yes, air filters get dirty, but I could still see the original green color of my air filter. Um, yah, it doesn't need replacing just yet. What else you got?\n\nHe says my coolant is low. How much is that? $3. Ok add it on. Even though it would be cheaper to buy my own coolant and fill it myself. I give in. \n\nMy car was pretty clean, so not much to vacuum, but the windows looked much better. Total cost was about $45.\n\n............Fast forward to the next morning. As I'm backing out of my garage this morning I notice a pool of oil on my garage floor!!! Why? Why? Why? I'm forever doomed for bad oil change experiences!!! So I call Jiffy Lube, ok good they're open on Sundays, and explain what happened. The guy apologizes and asks me to come back in. I say I'll be right over. They take a look at the car, top off the oil and clean up the leak. The guy explains some reason that doesn't make sense to me-something about the make of my cars oil pan and engine shape? I don't believe it. Why would something be wrong with my car all of a sudden? I think the makers at Honda know what they're doing, and since this has never happened before, it doesn't make sense to give me this excuse now. \n\nI appreciate that they fixed whatever mistake it was, and apologized for the problem. Just admit the error next time, don't blame it on the way my car is made. That just sounds like complete B.S.	1
	1991	so annoying to eat here during lunch! I will not be back again during lunch time. I had to take TWO hours from work today just because service was SO SLOW and parking is terrible. we ordered our food at 12:15 and it didn't arrive until 12:45. (note: none of us ordered anything that took long to cook, we ordered the broiled chicken salad and the veggie burger).  we scarfed our meal down and paid our bill, but then had to wait around another 10 minutes because our server had forgotten to bring my friend a to-go box. eventually I ended up just walking up to the food prep line and asking for a to-go box.  I'm not sure if they need to hire more staff or what, but they need to do something about the awful and slow lunchtime service.	1
	1992	We stayed at Aria for two nights this past weekend. The building is very very big and difficult to get around. It felt a little too secluded from the rest of the strip, even though in theory it's right next to many other places, it takes forever to walk out of the resort to the actual strip. \n\nI also felt very nickel and dimed during our stay, but maybe this is just Vegas. You cannot use the fridge in your room. If you do put anything inside of it you will be charged $25/day. There are sensors inside the fridge so if you touch anything inside of it, you will be charged. You also cannot touch any of the snacks on the table because they too have sensors and are insanely overpriced ($30 for chocolate). They do have a note next to the fridge and snacks that indicate this, so thankfully we didn't get swindled. \n\nThere was no coffee pot in the room, so you had to buy extremely overpriced coffee from their restaurants. Honestly, when you pay this much for a room you expect to at least have coffee available in the room and access to the fridge. \n\nWe ordered room service one night and the food was not the best and really over priced. \n\nThe mattress in our room was very soft, so we didn't sleep very well. But if you enjoy softer mattresses you'll be fine. \n\nThe staff, however, are incredibly nice and helpful! The theatre is also great, we saw Zarkana and it was spectacular.	1
	1993	With a name like Ping Pang Pong, you're not sure if you're headed to one of 'those' shows in Thailand or sitting down for some dim sum at a Chinese restaurant.  When in Vegas, it's the latter...at least in this case.\n\nSeeing billboards all over town advertising their dim sum, I must admit, I was very hesitant.  I would even say I wanted not to like it.  But I did, believe or not.  Ping Pang Pong located in the Gold Coast Casino has some of the better dim sum I've tried in Vegas, and I've been to a few.\n\nIt's a smaller restaurant than the only ones I've tried (listed below) and you can watch the casino floor as you dine.\n\nSaturday morning and we were seated rather quickly.  Quite a few Chinese people eating dim sum here as well, which is always a good sign.  They give you a menu with prices which is a bit unique for dim sum, but definitely helpful.  (Price ranges split into four categories for the most part - A plates are $2.18; B plates are $2.88; C plates are $3.88; and D plates are $5.88. ) Immediately after you're seated, the dim sum carts come your way.  If you can' t find what you're looking for, but it's on the menu, wave a server down and they'll order it for you.  \n\nPing Pang Pong has a surprisingly large selection of dim sum choices and it's pretty good.  Regular steamed dim sum range in the A and B categories.  They even had the elusive Shark Fin Dumpling ($5.88), but no Shanghai dumpling.  They also give you the bottle of red vinegar as opposed to the dinky little soy sauce dish amount.  The Shark Fin Dumpling had a nice mushroom broth too that was quite tasty and stood out.  They didn't have the Pineapple Custard bun that I love so much, but they had the plain Pineapple Bun ($2.18).  The BF especially loved their Macanese Egg Tarts ($3.88).  He hasn't had them since being in Macau and even had an order to go. \n\nThey have a decent amount of 'cool sweets' in the B plates - Red Bean Pudding Cake, Chilled Mango and Pink Grapefruit Cocktail, Tapioca and Purple Rice Pudding, Lychee Pudding, etc.  'Warm' and 'hot sweets' range from A through C categories and include Baked Tapioca Green Tea Pudding, Steamed Egg White and Sweet Cream, Seared Water Chestnut Pudding Cake, Thousand Layer Cake, etc. \n\nService was okay.  We did have to wave the servers down as only certain people can assist you with special orders while others only clear tables and push the carts.  \n\nPrices weren't too expensive either and I would say it's moderately priced for a casino.  The only downfall would be if you came with a very large party.  It might take awhile to get seated if they are extremely busy.  \n\nNonetheless, looks like Ping Pang Pong might be where I'm headed when I want some dim sum in the desert.\n\nRankings for dim sum in Vegas thus far:\n1) Ping Pang Pong\n2) Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine\n3) Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant\n4) Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant\n5) Cathay House Restaurant\n\nSidenote: When you ask for hot sauce, be sure to specify hot chili oil.  It'll be the good stuff instead of the red sauce with chili flakes.  Well, it's the good stuff I prefer with my dim sum.  And of course, hot yellow mustard too.\n\nUpdated! 06/10/07 - We returned again yesterday for dim sum and imagine my surprise when I saw pickled pig's feet being served!  This delicacy is usually only served after a woman gives birth.  A bunch of the older women relatives would come over and take over your kitchen while stewing up this stuff for you.  Once in awhile, I would wake up to this wonderful aroma when my mom felt the desire to make it.  I used to joke that I would have kids just to have people make this for me!  Now I can enjoy this vinegary fatty goodness anytime at Ping Pang Pong!  Yay!  For our party of five, it was about $100 with tip and tax.\n\nUpdated! 03/02/08 - Went to dim sum on Sunday...arrived around 2:35 pm and was reminded they closed at 3 pm.  We were fine with that and were quick to load our table with all the dim sum dishes we wanted.  The staff horded around our table asking if we wanted to make any final orders since the kitchen was closing up, and we said we were good.  With that, the check was presented to our table.  We continued eating and it wasn't long before the server reached across for the bill.  (I told her it wasn't taken care of yet.)  She pulled back in surprise and walked away.  She then returned to tell me they were closing out the register, so could we pay?  \n\nI have been to other dim sum restaurants where you are 'allowed' to eat, despite the kitchen part closing.  It was pretty discouraging that they were so overanxious to get our money and to get rid of us.  The dim sum lady obviously hated her job 'cuz she was banging the little dishes around.   \n\nNote to self: Don't bother going to PPP after 2:00 for dim sum, service is crap.  Food is okay though...but going downhill.  Seek other dim sum restaurants SOON!  I brought their star rating down from a four to a three!	2
	1994	"I went in with my expectations appropriately lowered after reading all the reviews, and you know what?  I wasn't disappointed.\n\nFirst off, this is a great deal for lunch.  $9 + tip and that includes a drink.  I went in around 3:15 and stayed for the shiftover to \""dinner\"" at 3:45 and it was exactly the same thing, with the added benefit of a steak (and something else) cooked to order.  I found that they had a fair range of items; all the staples of fast food Chinese--orange chicken, honey chicken, teriyaki chicken, spare ribs, Mongolian BBQ...plus more.  I wasn't too happy with the actual taste of the choices, but for $9 it can't be beat.  \n\nI probably won't be returning, but I don't regret trying it out.  I guess I'd prefer a classic \""around the world\"" buffet that includes Asian specialties among others."	2
	1995	back for quiche Lorraine and chocolate croissant, still a fan...	3
	1996	"An airport with slot machines and free wi-fi? Uber. I steer clear of the slot machines, but they serve as a welcome to those who specifically come to Las Vegas to gamble.. And personally, I think it gives the airport \""personality\"" instead of just the typical rows of fast food options & chain restaurants.\n\nAlso, they have fast-moving lines for taxis and make a spur of the moment Las Vegas trip more convenient by providing numerous options for booking a mode of transportation on the spot to get you to your hotel.\n\nI'm not too big a fan of their baggage claim.. not sure if I should blame this on the airline as opposed to the airport, but three out of the four times I've flown into McCarran (staying northeast of LA for a while made it easier to drive the 3.5 hours rather than fly) using different airlines in the past year and a half, my luggage has taken longer than usual (30mins+) to appear on the conveyor."	3
	1997	Gotta Love H&J !! Spices to die for!! Crab to Lust for.. Def one of my favorite places to eat in vegas! \nPS dont go here if you have somewhere to be later in the day.. you will smell like spices.. and seafood.. and deliciousness!!	4
	1998	I agree. The only time i ever went to this JITB, a fight broke out where people were smashing each others heads against the metal railing. I'll never forget that, i'll also never forget the fries they failed to serve me as a result of the chaos.\n\nStay focus JITB employees. We need our fries.	0
	1999	Rudy's is amazing there food is the best I have ever had! There customer service is top notch I highly recommend this place	4
	2000	After seating myself at the bar and taking my first sip of Bud Light, I logged onto Yelp and was disappointed to see all of the unfavorable reviews of this place. But, since there are limited dining options in Terminal D, I decided to stay. And I'm glad I did.\n\nSeveral of the prior reviewers were disappointed in the service. The bartender today was about as cheerful and attentive as one could ask for. He seemed to genuinely enjoy interacting with all the people passing through to their various destinations.\n\nGiven that this is a Burke establishment, I ordered a bit out of the box for me - the prosciutto and arugula pizza. In one word: outstanding. Paired with a 9-ounce pour of BV Cabernet, I was in gastric heaven.\n\nWhile, as other reviewers noted, this is a bit pricey, it is an airport after all. My pizza was $13.99 but would easily feed two adults. Drink prices were a bit steep, but I've come to expect that in airports.\n\nI would do it again. And I probably will.	3
	2001	I have used Brad Briggs for years, but not anymore. It is taking over a month to get an appointment with Serena the dental hygenist. She is wonderful, gentle and kind and also Brads sister.. Dr. Brad tried to talk me into replacing 10 of my front teeth with those new fake ones. Nothing was wrong with my front teeth. They are mine. So he shaved down a small portion of one front tooth that is now a place for debris to collect. They refunded my money ( $10,000), but I still never really had faith in them anymore. Brad has a negative attitude lately, I don't know why. Perhaps, he is just a loser.	1
	2002	First time in Las Vegas and I was able to pass by and check out the neon boneyard. This place is awesome, they allow you to take pictures of the great neon signs and get information on their history and what they were used for and for which business'. I would visit again. Just a tip: during the hotter months bring water and sun screen. There are not many places for shade on the tour, it's very easy to get a sun burn.	4
	2003	I just went there for dinner this evening. I've never had a pasty before, but this place has been recommended to me many times. I have to say, it did not disappoint. \n\nI got the Oggie and my buddy got the Italian. I never tasted rutabagas before, but i felt they worked very well inside the pasty. It was quite delicious, but i have to say, when i return i shall probably try something else. \n\nMy buddy said the Italian was great. It was essentially a calzone, but he swears it was better than any calzone he had ever gotten at a pizza place.	3
	2004	We ordered take out and had extra sauce and ricotta cheese. Really good pizza! Also had cheesecake for dessert. Service was excellent and easy to park and pick up!	4
	2005	I come here not as a hunter, fisher, or boater but as a parent who appreciates the distraction it provides. My daughter loves to look at the fish and follow the pawprints. The 20 minute break is well worth the free happiness it provides. Oh... if she could just stay 3 forever. She is so much cheaper to entertain.	3
	2006	They STEAL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n The worst hotel ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I\nIt hurts me a lot to give them a star!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nOne of my friend came from China to visit mea few weeks ago. He checked  in on Mar 7. And we went to a NBA game, Phoenix Suns VS Huston Rockets. His biggest American dream come true. He had a wonderful trip in the US until on Mar 11. He left his room around 8:30 am and I took him back to his hotel at 3:00pm, he found out his $9000.00 camera was gone. Also the charger was in the side pocket of his backpack, which was at least a yard a way from the camera, was gone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The people who took the camera, apparently searched his room. We call the general manager immediately, he came, listened, then told us that he's be back with us very soon. After 4 hours of waiting, we went into his office, he told us that the technician told us that only 2 people entered the room, one my friend, the other, the housekeeper, DUH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He told us he needed 12-15 hours for an answer, but he didn't. By the time we checked out, on march 14th, that was the last time we saw the general manager, his name is Angel. He told us that everything was out of his hand. We had to complain to the Holiday Inn Corp. Guest Relationship. They told us someone would contact us no more than 2 days, 2 weeks later, I have to complain again because no one contacted me. Now its been more than 3 weeks. STILL no contact. Now it's time for people to know what happened In HOLIDAY INN. THEY STEAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE DO NOT stay here if you have a choice. If you have no choice, KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.	0
	2007	"GHETTO! \nInstead of getting in line, I just went and asked how much for bottle service as we usually do in Vegas. The \""VIP host\"" Josh had a stank face on from the beginning. \nI asked how much for a bottle and he says he can do buy one get one free. Okay fine, buy one bottle of Ketel and get one bottle of Ketel free right? He says yes. Okay we're sold.\nWe walk in and he keeps telling us that we can sit here and there for another hundred dollars. NO, that is not the price we settled on. After we say no, he goes on to ask the other members of our group if they wanted it. He started cussing at us after we all turned him down. RUDE!\nHe the walked us to our table and says \""So are you going to tip or what?\"" WTH? You expect a tip after asking us for one AND cussing at us because we couldn't be hustled? \nI've never been so mis-treated EVER! Our waitress then took FOREVER to bring out our bottles and MAGICALLY forgot to bring back one of our credit cards. Needless to say, we didn't see her after we paid and received our bottles. The busser did everything for her to receive $250 gratuity...and that buy one get one deal for Ketel? SIKE...it's buy one bottle of Ketel and get a bottle of nasty Sky for free!!\nThe crowd was terrible!! Never seen so many beggers in one place! The bottle rats came every 2 mins. and the guys tried to swarm when half my group was gone. The employees and crowd make this a dirt club, I will never return."	0
	2008	It gives Bellagio Buffet a run for its money.  I had easter brunch here once and it was awesome.  The set up is light and airy.  You have to know that there is a good chance you will wait in a garguantuan snail moving line and that you will pay more for the buffet than any other strip hotel, but hey people, its the Wynn and the food is freaking good too.  Everyone should try it once.	4
	2009	Two and a half stars. Very overrated IMO. The food would best be described as bland and greasy.  I was really excited when this place opened up but I've been twice now and it has been disappointing both times. Too bad.	1
	2010	It's been a few months since I've been here, and what a change, not for the better. I usually get the same thing to start with, ceviche and pollo asado. Both are usually quite delicious, not this time.\n\nThe ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it. As if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible. I did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least. Now for the tacos. Stale taco shells, dried and overcooked chicken, slopped on guac and no pico de gallo. The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo, since they did not put any on, and then I was charged $1.00 extra. Of course, no manager was anywhere in sight. This place simply doesn't care. On the bright side, the margaritas and salsa are still good, but the chips were stale.\n\nNot only will I not return, but I can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town. I see dozens of new business people every day who stay in Scottsdale and they always ask for Mexican food, and I've always said Cien Agaves. No more.	0
	2011	"Being new to CG I've been working my way around to the local spots for breakfast and lunch. Big House knows what to do in the kitchen for sure! Great sandwiches and breakfasts. Small, local, & yummy.  Jalape\u00f1o Melt is my fave but the Greek salad is a close second. And the eggs, home fried potatoes, and green chili breakfast wasnt too bad either! \n\nps- a large ice tea to go is 44oz. Hope you're thirsty! Oh, and be prepared to wait 40-50 mins for your order. Not sure if they only have one cook, or maybe just one stove top, or maybe there really were \""two large parties of 20\"" being served in the back room (that the waitress later confirmed held only up to 25 people)."	2
	2012	"Love this place!\n\nWhen I think of a local, trendy coffee shop, I think Espresso a Mano. The coffee here is super fresh, very tasty, and \""artistic\"" - yes - artistic! You'll see when you look at the \""picture\"" that's in your coffee.\n\nI love the atmosphere, too. I would go here many, many time over a Starbucks. Highly recommended!"	4
	2013	I have a love hate relationship with this store. I love the super low prices on groceries and selection of bulk items. I hate the warehouse feel this place has to it. Concrete floors and metal bays where they shove palettes of food in is a yuck. \n\nThey have a lot of things but just not much of a selection when it comes down to certain things. They do however have pretty good produce and you can't beat the prices on some of them (48 cents a pound for vine tomatoes anyone?). You do have to bag your own groceries and they only have one bag stand at each belt, so that's kind of annoying. But with the amount I'm saving I don't mind bagging my own stuff :)	3
	2014	To say that I am obsessed with their riccolina dish would not do how much I love it justice. I've ordered that pasta dish the last 7-8 times I've been there, no lie. It's so good! I don't know how they do it with the truffle oil, mushrooms, and arugula, but it is just oh so perfect.\n\nI love the laid-back decor of Osteria; the simplicity of it all really draws me in. Outside of the riccolina, I would have to give a thumbs up to the warm tomato appetizer, the spaghetti and the rigatoni. They are all super delicious. Only one of the pasta dishes have we tried that I would recommend you pass on, though I can't recall it now (I think it was a special).\n\nI also tend to like the bread they serve prior to your meal. Yummy.\n\nThe menu is not extensive (as every menu should not be), but the items they have are quite tasty as far as the pastas go. I've only ever sat at the bar and the bartenders at first came off as kind of cold, but then we realized they just weren't chatty. Which is weird when you're a bartender, but oh well. I like this place.	3
	2015	"It's been less than a year since my last review (July).  This is also the first time I've been back since then.  We had a \""restaurant.com\"" certificate to use here.  The certificate is not honored for the buffet, so we ordered off the menu.  I had their fried chicken, my wife had their jerk chicken.\n\nFirst...the fried chicken is fresh.  It takes 25 minutes because they don't fry it till you order it.  I like that.  When it came out it had an interesting look to it.  This is not the medium brown fried chicken of KFC.  It was a light, almost yellowish, fried chicken.  And it was very tasty.  I liked it.  The jerk chicken was tasty as well, but didn't seem quite right...until we dipped it in the jerk sauce.  Yowza.  Some serious heat there.  But THAT was jerk chicken.\n\nThe sides I ordered were vegetables and rice/beans.  The vegetables were a disappointment.  I was told steamed cabbage and carrots (I'm not a fan, but I try to eat healthy stuff anyway).  It was mostly cabbage.  Very little carrots.  The rice/beans were OK.  Nothing special.  The flavor wasn't as robust as I expected.\n\nMy wife ordered the rice/beans, and the fried plantains.  She loved the plantains.\n\nService was sketchy.  Just the one guy behind the bar who tended not to clear tables until someone came in needing a table.  Then he'd stop chatting with whoever was at the bar, clear the table, and seat them.  He also didn't really check on us at all.  Of course, in such a small place I could get his attention easily if I needed.\n\nI think this is worthy of three stars.  If you read my review from a few weeks ago you'll see I really liked Caribbean Spice.  This place is OK, but Caribbean Spice is better."	2
	2016	Chris and his crew do a great job!!!  We recently went to Tempe Paintball for a work function.  Our group consisted of the United Nations, 3 Brits, 2 Aussies, a Singaporean, a few Gringos and a partridge in a pear tree.  No one in the group the group had ever played paintball before, but after the first game everyone thought that they were Navy Seals or MI6.  \n\nThe best part of Tempe Paintball was that we were able to have a place to ourselves since in the early part of the week they are only open to private parties.  So we were able to shoot the crap out of each other for 2 straight hours (that was all we needed).  Everyone who went to the event says that it was the most fun that they had had in a long time.  For a great group outing you cant beat the fun and the price.	4
	2017	Michael and Deanna in the electronic department are great! They were so helpful and provided excellent customer service. Deanna, put the customers needs first and made sure we were taken care of.  I will continue to shop for all of my electronic needs at this wal-mart.	4
	2018	I went here on a Saturday morning right after opening. First for the positives: it was a very clean facility, very friendly staff, and I loved that they were playing kids movies rather than shows that would not be ok for my kids to see. Negative: There was only one other person in the lobby and check in still took 10-15 minutes. Secondly I was the only patient there at the time I was called back and I sat in the room and sat there for at least 20 minutes while I heard the nurses talking instead of tending to the patient-Me! I thought it was ridiculous that they were talking about dinner plans while I sat there with a 102.5 degree fever a week after delivering my son. I had to stick my head out the door and ask if or when someone would be coming- they replied it would be just a minute. It was at least 5 more minutes while they finished their conversation. The nurse proceeded to prescribe me an antibiotic that would not be the best choice ( according to my dr two days later and the pharmacist) for my nursing newborn. I told each of the nurses at least twice each I was nursing . Also when needing a urine sample I had to go into a restroom that was also used for drug screening so the toilet was not able to flush and I couldn't use the sink to wash my hands. I had to ask to wash my hands outside the room in the testing area.\nOverall, as with any other urgent care I feel that a patient gets inadequate treatment. Every time I go to one of these places they misdiagnose me or my children. I was not happy with the speed of treatment here. As the only patient it still took me an hour and a half-- this was just for diagnosis, a flu screen, and a urine test. However, the staff was friendly and it seemed very clean. Still better than the ER for moderate health needs.	2
	2019	My hubby and I are vacationing in Vegas and on our list of must eat restaurants, was Bouchon. \n\nToo bad our experience was a big disappointment. \n\nWe arrived for our reservation on thursday, excited about the upcoming culinary experience... The hostess was friendly, seated us and then about 15 mins later a man, who never introduced himself asked us about our water preference. We only realized later, when he came back, still never making eye contact,  he was our waiter. This was probably one of my worst restaurant experiences ever. \n\nWhen i asked him about the chicken dish- i was expecting some description on the preparation or even his opinion ( which I love to hear from waiters!), instead he pointed to my menu and read it line for line. That was about the most interaction we got all night\nHe never came to check on us, his eyes always looking at his colleagues, no smiles, just seemed bothered to be there\n\nIt's one thing to be ignored when the restaurant is busy-- but literally be forgotten when there are empty tables surrounding you, is too much. He never bothered to check in on the apps or entree were. \n\ni would have overlooked all of this, if the entrees were as good as the appetizers. Endive salad and onion soup were delicious (and the reason  i gave this place two stars) Steak frites was just ok. My hubby didn't even finish it, which is surprising for him....my Chicken was cooked well, great crisp, but  again, only ok.\n\nAll in all, the wait staff needs some training... Smile, talk to your customers, a little eye contact and fake small talk will go a long way with tourists and maybe even yield a good tip!	1
	2020	I have to say I was a bit apprehensive after the negative reviews, but lvh was good to me...upgraded my room because it was my honeymoon for only 10 dollars more..That got us a Grand Room with a fridge, coffee maker, couch, ottoman, double beds, vanity area and a huge bathroom. ..Their showerhead weas amazing and we had no problems with water draining or pressure...Sure there are little dings and dents but lets be honest this is not the Wynn or Belliago ....For 200 bucks for 4 days 3 nights I would surely stay there again and they were very hospitable down to the housekeepers...	3
	2021	Great casual bar with inexpensive cocktails. I was nervous to get a cocktail with gin but must say it was very well balanced. Definitely a great bar to pop into if u live in the area and want to grab some cocktails. I look forward to returning.	3
	2022	I recently discovered Wing Stop and have already tried their boneless wings three times. The boneless wings have light, crunchy breading that isn't greasy. They also use big chunks of white meat chicken, so you get a good amount of meat as well. There are about 10 different flavors of sauce to try. My favorite so far is the cajun. It's a very spicy combination of buffalo-style sauce and cajun herbs/spices. Next, I like the Louisiana rub, which is similar, but dryer and less spicy. Some other good flavors are BBQ, Hawaiian, teriyaki, and lemon pepper. The boneless wings are priced nicely at $0.60 each every day of the week. I have also tried the seasoned french fries, which are pretty good, but not a must-have.  \n\nThe wings are made to order, which means you should expect to wait about 10 minutes after placing your order. There is a small dining room at this location with about 10 tables, but you can also order take-out at the counter or call ahead. The staff has been pretty friendly on my visits. I would say the quality of service and food crushes the nearby Buffalo Wild Wings, so I will definitely choose Wing Stop from now on.	3
	2023	Very nice place with extremely friendly staff.  The food was similar quality to other Mexican food places in the NW Valley....good but not spectacular.   Very good portions for the price.  \n\nI don't live close by but will certainly go back when I am in the area.	3
	2024	Best Thai food ever! I eat here when ever I want Thai.	4
	2025	"SHEESH...I guess if you arent familar with a \""dive bar\"" this would fit in your description. It is more like uh..TGIF Fridays of dive bars. Theres random stuff on the walls, enough coke(not pepsi) residue in the bathroom to keep the party goin, graffitti and stickers everywhere. BUT hey they also have soap, toliet paper, and paper towels. not to mention an actual ladies bathroom with a lock. Usually a true dive bar will have one maybe two but not all four. That is a TGIF my friends. I regress, I have lived in Vegas for many years and have been going there since before I was legally allowed, and also met my exhusband there. I have seen it when it was an actual dive bar and they had the mechanial horse that you had to be both female and topless to ride and miget porn on the tvs and bras hanging from the rafters. thats a dive bar! now, its like a dive bar with training wheels. Picture booth? come on! IF you remember yr stay at a dive bar, you aint doin it right, ass juice or not."	1
	2026	Love this place!!! Came here for lunch yesterday and I about inhaled the entire bowl of chips and salsa :) BEST I HAVE EVER HAD! I was on a quick lunch break so I ordered off the light lunch menu and had a chicken quesadilla, which had carmalized onions and gave it a sweet taste. I will definitely be back! Yum!\n\n4 Stars due to the fact that we requested 2 bowls of the salsa, but additional chips were never brought to the table. Maybe a good thing as I couldn't keep my hands out of the bowl :)	3
	2027	When you turned away a patient in pain at the front desk, even when she had a valid insurance that covers and lists the name of this clinic, you effectively told me to write a 1 star review.\n\nI do understand things can get busy, but when you lose compassion for a patient, you should question your raison d'\u00eatre.	0
	2028	Good happy hour appetizers, great mojito, don't sit outside where the birds can land on the structure above you... They eat lotsa fries and well, if it goes in... It's gotta come out... Sit upstairs...crab bisque is good and a kid menu...pricey but overall pretty good.	2
	2029	Game Depot is a small-to-midsized gaming store, selling everything from RPG rulebooks, and dice to board games, and minis. The store is clean, organized and well lit, with tables laid out for gamers to use. The staff are knowledgeable, helpful and decidedly non-creepy.\n\nThe bathroom is small but clean, a very pleasant change from other gaming stores I've patronized.\n\nThey don't have a LAN section, so if you're looking for computer-based gaming, I'd recommend Gamer's Inn, another gaming shop in the Valley. They don't sell snacks or drinks, so if you're planning a long session, I'd recommend you bring your own.\n\nTheir selection of dice, paints and assorted gaming-related gadgets are second to none and I strongly recommended them to other gamers in the Valley.	4
	2030	Will not be going again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI was super excited to check out Kokoro because I live down town but the best it had to offer is location.  First of they have no bath rooms hello where do you wash your hands......  The food was not fresh at all I watched as the waitress took the edamame out of the freezer and placed it in the microwave I am not a sushi snob but the rice fell apart upon touch the fish and ginger was dry. My husband and I paid our bill and actually went to another restaurant where we ordered the exact same thing and paid 10 dollars less at another down town sushi bar	0
	2031	Finally, a LV sushi restaurant truly deserving of all its accolades! What can I add that hasn't already been said? We've been longing for a high quality sushi restaurant, ever since experiencing Sushi Sasabune, twice I might add, in Honolulu. After trying one local restaurant after the other, all rated 4 to 5 stars on Yelp, we were greeted with disappointment again and again, until now. Expensive but oh so delicious, Kabuto is a gift from the sushi gods, and I am only too eager to return to worship at this temple.	4
	2032	"When I first needed a Banker or any financial assistance, this was my first bank to go to since I lived right down the street. After an issue with my account I walked in to talk to a banker, everyone was super friendly at this branch, but the Banker James was always going the extra mile...which, of course makes your experience there so much better. \n\nJames reassures me that everything will be taken care of and every time he reassures me that \""everything will be taken care of\"" I know I am in good hands and I can go about my day not worrying about a thing. \n\nI moved to Boston a few Months ago from Scottsdale. There is no WF in Boston...but I have been working with James who always makes me feel like I'm a priority and when I call him and leave him a message...my phone call is returned in a very timely fashion. I'd just say he's probably one of the reasons I have not switched banks all together and decided to stay with Wells.  I love working with him, it's great to know that customer service still exists. Thanks James!!\n\nIf anyone needs a bank/banker/ financial assistance, check this particular location and ask for James. He's awesome!!"	4
	2033	Me and Hubby went here for our anniversary.  We went for brunch.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Bar Marco has a cool, laid back vibe.  I loved the feel inside with the brick walls and beautiful ceiling.  We started with their bread basket appetizer.  The bread come out warm and wonderful.  The strawberry jam that came with it was so yummy!  There were 4 kinds of bread and all were delightful.  I chose the Rosemary French Toast - WOW!  I also got a side of grits.  The grits were seriosly seasoned to perfection and they were the perfect consistancy.  The hubby got the grits too and LOVED them as well.  He chose the buttermilk pancakes for his dish.  They were delightful as well...light and fluffy perfect.  And the bacon that came with them, great maple flavor!  I had a cocktail because I read the reviews and it looked as though everyone noted the cockails are terrific.  I chose the Blue Moon and it was light and delicious!  All in all Bar Marco is a wonderful little place with a cool vibe, wonderful food, and terrific cocktails!	3
	2034	Douche bag central! \n\nLike douche bags? Want to get treated like shit? Want to hang out with people who think they are the shit? Come here! Waste money!\n\nWe tried to get in on Sunday for Rehab this past weekend and it was a fuckin clusterfuck!\n\nWaited in line, got let up to the front of the line. DB bouncer told us that we cut in line. Say what? Puh-lease, don't be an ass. You want to charge girls $50 to get in and guys $100??\n\nAnd then you are gonna bust attitude on me and call me a fuckin liar? \n\nEff that! I ain't having this shiet. \n\nRehab can suck it. Wet Republic is way better than this place. \n\nAnd no, I did not waste my money here. Who wants to pay for shitty attitude?	0
	2035	Rays pizza....what can I say other than AMAZING pizza! Everything about rays is delicious.  I have tried almost everything on the menu and I have always left satisfied! You couldn't ask for a better pizzeria!  Staff is extremely friendly!  If you are looking to satisfy your taste buds then make sure you stop in at Rays. This is a new favorite spot for me!	4
	2036	This is a neighborhood joint in Grayhawk which has a nice ambiance. However the food and service could really use an upgrade. This was my first trip here, and perhaps a Monday night didn't have the best and brightest working. I'll give it a second try.	2
	2037	"I'm a coffee snob I guess. \n\nMax and I were trying to kill time while the traffic lightened up on the 15 back to san diego, so we walked around the Paris Hotel after visiting friends in Henderson.  We have a certain affinity to Paris and the Eiffel Tower since thats where he proposed to me.   I was immediately drawn to this coffeeshop/dessert place because the chairs reminded me of a place in Paris off of St.Germain.  A great street.  \n\nSo we stop and I decide I want an espresso Affogato style.  Basically, its espresso poured over ice cream or gelato.  Yum.  When i finally got someones attention and asked for it, the woman looked at me like \""whathefudgeisthat?\""  I had to explain and she still seemed annoyed at me.  Hey woman, shouldn't you know what that is being that you're trying to replicate Parisian Coffee in a hotel called Paris!   Ha, I had to take my cuppa espresso and a scoop of ice cream and do it myself.  Lame-oh."	2
	2038	Despite the 30-min wait to get bottle service and a table, Tao underscores big time. We decided to leave after just 15 minutes inside. It was way too crowded and sweaty. People were good looking and very well dressed, but it still wasn't fun. And what is up with the girls bathing in rose pedals... and the drunk guys who jumped in...	1
	2039	i love trying different independent coffee spots so made the trek from Hendertucky this morning to Holley's...nice vibe, good coffee and Holley on the job making it happen...I'm a fan.	3
	2040	We are close enough to walk here.  It's been in the neighborhood for a long time.  Last year we came on Friday's several times for the $5 appetizers and really enjoyed them.  The same thing we are enjoying tonight!  The fried calamari was light and crispy, served with a pretty good dipping sauce, and the crab and artichoke dip was served pipping hot!  It had big chunks of crab inside.\n\nI ordered the blackened Mahi Mahi fish taco's, it was a little disappointing, the fish had hardly any flavor and were small.  I have had better items from their menu.  The prices are good, the service is excellent, overall, it's a good place for some fairly decent seafood.	3
	2041	Great place to race go karts! Really fast cars and super fun time was had by our teenage boys and teen at heart parents. Great fun just off the strip.	4
	2042	Went here on a Saturday evening after hearing good things. It's located in a old strip mall. From outside doesn't look like much but don't judge a book by its cover. The inside is very inviting with large tvs, and a dark modern decor. \nLuckily we had called ahead and made a reservation because there was a 20min wait when we got there. The total seating is on the small side so I'd recommend calling ahead. \nThey're still working out the kinks and getting up to speed because the service was a little erratic. From wrong drinks and food items being brought out, it took a while to get everything sorted. \nTo start we ordered the nachos flat with avocado and pork. It was awesome, would def recommend. We also tried the Mac and cheese with fusilli pasta. Also recommended! \nFor entree, I had the PBLT, pork belly lettuce tomato sandwich. It came with just house made chips, I would've liked an option of fries instead. The pork belly was well cooked and moist but tasted very salty. I'm not sure if I was being sensitive but I could only finish half the sandwich. \nOverall a good meal for the nachos and macncheese. Wish there was a happy hour to try as well.	2
	2043	"It's pretty tough to find decent Chinese in Scottsdale.  Jade Palace is an ok option if you have a serious craving for Chinese, but rarely will you think \""Gee, let's go to Jade Palace to get some quality food\"".\nThe food is mediocre at best.  Nothing really stands out on the menu.  I've been a handful of times because it's so close to where I live...each time I get something different hoping for the best.  Each time I walked away thinking I should have spent my money elsewhere.\nIf considering Jade Palace, ask yourself this:\nDo I have a serious craving for Chinese that wont go away if I eat anything else?  Do I live within 5 minutes of Jade Palace?  Do I like dining with people who average 85 years old?\nIf yes, go.  Otherwise move on..."	1
	2044	I love this place.  Frankly I'd rather go to pinkberry than an ice cream shop- and I'm not a health nut or anything.\n\nI enjoy the tartness of the original, and my usual order is a small original with mango, raspberries and maybe some mochi.\n\nSometimes I like to go for half original / half chocolate... however, although I do love chocolate, I found that getting a whole cup of just chocolate was overkill.  I think if you don't have the original in there for contrast, you eventually stop being able to taste the chocolate by the end.\n\nThey have a seasonal peppermint flavor that is just fantastic (with peppermint bark and dark chocolate crisps, it's great.  Also, try some pomegranate seeds... oddly they work well together).\n\nAll of their other flavors are tasty, but it's the original that keeps me coming back.\n\nOh, and I recommend the fresh fruit topping instead of the candy (except on the peppermint)... it just works better.	4
	2045	Not really sure what the hype is about this bakery. the concept is lovely but the cupcakes are dry and the icing is nothing to get excited about. I've sampled the vanilla and chocolate and once tried a raspberry bread. All dry dry dry.... won't go back	1
	2046	It's average. I don't think the quality of food here is that much better than some take out places, so for the money I think you're better off elsewhere.  Problem is there's not much good Chinese around South Charlotte. If you go you can expect a nice seating area, good service and okay food.	2
	2047	"I've been to the South Phoenix location a few times, and am really happy they opened this new location much closer to home.  I was a little worried that quality might fall off, especially if they're trucking meats between locations, but I was happy to find the quality is the same. The staff is friendly and eager to guide you through the menu.  \n\nBeing a Texas-style BBQ joint, the star of the show is the brisket. It has a rich, smoky flavor, and the \""moist\"" (i.e. fattier) brisket is a piece of Texas heaven. The other meats are also really good, but you can't come here without having the brisket. The link sausage is really good too, coarsely ground with that rich smoky flavor. Both the original and spicy sauces are very good.  I haven't had any of the ribs, so I can't speak to another reviewer's complaint that they were dry and not flavorful. I'll give them a try and update. \n\nOverall, this is definitely worth a visit if you like good, TEXAS-STYLE bbq. If you don't know what Texas BBQ is and you go expecting Carolina, or Memphis, or something like that, you may not like it. But for Texas-style BBQ it is the best in town.  You'll feel like you're at the New Zion Baptist Church BBQ in Huntsville."	4
	2048	Eh, not great, but not terrible. WAY overpriced though!\n\nThe usual buffet items were here, nothing too exciting. Chicken, mashed potatoes, pizza, etc. Neither of us eat prime rib, so unfortunately that wasn't a draw. \n\nWe both agreed that the regular food wasn't great, but the dessert was really good. There were mini pies (pecan, lemon meringue), chocolate mousse, Napoleons, eclairs, ice cream, cupcakes, banana cream pie (my bf was extremely excited about that).	2
	2049	I just don't get it.  this place is like a homeless shelter but with even worse food.   I know it's southern style....but EVERYTHING is double fried...and you walk out of their feeling like death.\n\nIt's expensive ($25 pp with soda) and just not quality food.\n\nthis is worth a big SKIP....	0
	2050	Gas station McDonalds!  Well they keep it fairly clean inside, and there's minimal seating, and the drive-thru moves fairly quickly.  Plus you can get gas while you're there.  Had a couple errors on my orders but they're fast at breakfast time.	1
	2051	"I am a lover of the original Firefly (so much so that I was there 3  times in a week and a half recently)- so when I heard the new, much closer location in Summerlin was open- I brought my out of town guests here for some nibbles.\n\nI used to visit this building years ago when it was Z Tejas, and the new decor is right in line with the Firefly brand. Love the painted walls and the layout is not too crowded and not as loud. I would suggest a long communal table- truly Spanish style!\n\nHostess I called was much friendlier and more helpful than original location, and we had no wait to be seated (a first!) The dinner rush was subsiding, as it was after 9pm, but a fair amount of tables were still there- only a few were empty.\n\nWe ordered all of our regular items and most were really good. There is always a learning curve at any new place, and I took that in to account in this review.\n\nGarden Variety Salad- smaller than the original location and not as many \""goodies\"" but still very edible!\n\nBoquerones (Anchovy toast)- Good but bread not toasted- had to send back.  Beautiful presentation and this cook likes to use his sauce bottles;)\n\nArtichoke toast- Bread not toasted (really? it's on the menu as toast) and there was a little push back from the waiter when I sent them back to be toasted. Oil and dressing were fanstastic on these- much more flavorful than the original!\n\nMac n Cheese- excellent!\n\nStuffed Chilis- Amazing and on par with the original location.\n\nStaff\nWaiter had too many tables and wasn't all that attentive. He wasn't as familiar with the menu as I would have hoped- but again, they just opened. Luckily for him, he had good support.\n\nBusboy- AMAZING! If he wasn't trained at the original location, I would be surprised. He was very attentive and bent over backwards to make sure our meal was perfect after we sent back the toast(s).\n\nManager?- there was someone in a suit flittering around, not sure who he was, but he didn't stop and address the table- only the staff when we sent something back. Would have been nice for him to have received our feedback personally, not just from the staff. No harm done though, and I was glad to see someone was there.\n\nOverall- I can't wait for this place to gain some more experience and really shine! I will go back, I did enjoy the meal and wine and wouldn't hesitate to send friends there, with the caveat that they are still working out the kinks."	2
	2052	I was craving pasta and I wanted a quick fix, so I decided to come here. Biggest mistake ever. \n\nI ordered the Broccoli Pesto with angel hair pasta. Absolutely disgusting. It tasted like I was just taking bites out of raw garlic cloves. The garlic was so strong, it literally made my eyes water. \n\nThe pasta was cooked fine and the chicken was okay, if only I was able to actually taste the broccoli pesto, and not just clumps of garlic.\n\nThis hasn't been my first time here. I've order a few other times, and everything else that I've ordered in the past has always been bland, dry, and tasteless. \n\nAfter this experience, I probably will never go back...Unless my pasta craving is a do or die situation. I'll just have to learn how to be patient and cook my own pasta from now on.	0
	2053	Did a lot of business with this company decided to have an order done somewhere else asked for the artwork that I paid for been getting the runaround for a week now wasn't thrilled with the product that I got originally but the people were nice and planned on doing future business with them based on the hassles and trying to get my own property back from them May have to rethink that\n\n Will update good or bad.\n\nFinally got my artwork after owner talking all kinds of crap to my partner about me because I'd ask for a price and didn't move forward with an order guys a jerk don't recommend doing business with them	0
	2054	Inexpensive executive course even in peak season.  The greens can sometimes look diseased but all in all an ok place to golf.  \nStaff maybe short on a friendly smile but the green fees can usually cheer you up.  \nYou know the course can play fast when you got guys at the 19th drinking their 3rd PBR at 9am. Or they're having breakfast.	2
	2055	Been to the Gyro House many times, and have not been disappointed.  Gyro's are great and blows My Fat Greek out of the water.	4
	2056	Plush!\n\nThey completely renovated the entire theater. The seats recline fully are comfortable enough for even the most discerning rear. This theater is as nice as the green valley galaxy theater.\n\nIf you're in the north part of town, you have found your go-to movie theater.	4
	2057	I was looking for a good sushi place in Phoenix and I found it. I had albacore sushi and the shrimp roll on happy hour. The albacore was really good quality. They are not overpriced or stingy with the fish like a lot of other places. I think I have found my sushi spot on the west side!	3
	2058	"I am going to state upfront that I have rated the Genius Bar with 2 stars because the person assisting with getting people appointments, and getting people to their appointments couldn't even make eye contact with us when we were speaking with him to attempt to get an appointment. I guess I realize that you are a genius (supposedly) but this is not the place to play out your brooding. It is a customer service gig..... so I would suggest either getting your head outta the tablet surfing Apple Store internet and get some people skills.\n\nOK, rant complete. On to the Genius Bar... the technician that helped us was knowledgeable, and resolved my \""temperamental\"" iPhone If-you-don't-turn-me-off-every-few-days-or-so-I'll-turn-myself-off-and-lock-you-out-for-HOURS tantrum. However, following in the steps of the Genius Bar Host, she wasn't very friendly either. She kinda spoke to me like Help Desk technicians speak to people who shouldn't be using computers that call them with stupid questions like \""My computer wont come on\""\nTechnician: Did you turn it on?\nCustomer: Oh.... no I guess I didn't. \nWell, I am not a computer idiot but there are ALOT of things about iPhones that elude me; and many others from what I have googled. So to treat the people that have come to you for your unattainable knowledge (outside of the new hire training course) like rocks isn't very pleasant.\nThank you so much Apple Genius for restoring my iPhone child to its ordinary operating behavior but maybe next time we could get a smile or giggle outta ya?"	1
	2059	You know what's awesome? \n\nChili cheese fries for breakfast to nurse a Vegas sized hangover.	2
	2060	If I don't tell how would you know about one of the greatest foot message I have ever received while getting a pedi. So great!	3
	2061	This place is awesome  It'd be even more awesome if you are here on a business account.  it is pricey, and the drinks seem to be thimble sized.  But the sushi!  The sushi is impeccably fresh.  The sensai roll (triple color, yellowtail, tuna and salmon) is literally one of the best rolls I've had.  The rice was well seasoned (could use a smidge more vinegar) but a great foil and not too much rice. \nEgg custard is not to be missed.  Served in a little ceramic cup with a lid, it stays piping hot.  Smooth, rich and filled with seafood, it is amazing.  Another don't miss is the claims. The clams are dotted with truffled butter and miso before a quick broil.\nSo overall, loved this place.  it's pricier than even Roka Akor.  (They have sushi boats that start at $250.00) But the fish is amazing, the service is kind an worth stopping in at least once.  Weirdly for a really nice restaurant, they give you paper napkins rather than cloth.  Minor quibble, but I still found it weird given the attention to detail every where else.  The bar and tables for instance are some of the prettiest and comfortable pieces of furniture around.  But no cloth napkins?	3
	2062	"I almost hesitate to write an honest review about this place, lest the cat further escape from the bag. \n\nThe mani-pedi here beats the hell out of the one I had at the Camelback. No lie. They definitely spend an extra amount of time on the massage, even when they're busy. And the mani includes an extended neck and shoulder massage. My God. Heaven. Are they a few dollars more? I guess. I'm not sure, and I don't care.\n\nMinus 1/4 star because even though it's heavenly, it's somewhat unsettling to be rubbed into oblivion by a smiling Vietnamese woman who keeps asking \""You like? Feel good?\"", as it makes me feel a little pervy. Or maybe that's in my mind. I kind of like it either way. Minus 1/4 star because the services here do take a lot longer. This is not a quick stop you make while running errands on a Saturday. 1/2 star added back because of its proximity to AJ's, so you can get a giant iced coffee beforehand. If I could give an extra half star for nice facilities, sparkling cleanliness, and better-than-average English skills, I would.  Now go, let them rub you, and try not to think about where those hands have been."	4
	2063	Short and simple.\nIt's all about the ambiance and the atmosphere, baby! \n\nLike many have mentioned, this is old school Vegas. The superficiality, the glitz and glam of all those other prestigious restaurants on the strip....you can forgit-about-it!!! It's always good to go back in time and enjoy what Vegas was once all about.\n\nFood was delicious. (Of course it was...wouldn't expect anything less from a fine establishment like this.) One really cool thing they do here is that they make certain foods in front of you. We ordered a Cesar Salad and it was a fun experience to watch them prepare it for us. Ordered steak and shrimp scampi as our entrees, we were blissfully satisfied.\n\nAlso...they lit desserts on fire??!! Seriously. It looks cool to watch but we were so full from our dinner...I couldn't stomach anymore food. Maybe I'll just come here for dessert another time?\n\nDefinitely check this place out!	4
	2064	I had the wings there and the wing sauce was so good I went back a few days later and bought a container to put on chicken I made at home.  It is a great blend of sweet and spicy.  My wife has a veggie rueben that she thoroughly enjoyed.  We will be going back!  I just wish they were open on Sundays.	4
	2065	This Costco is huge! Almost twice as big as your average Costco...so make sure to wear comfortable shoes. \n\nThe selection here is also very different than other locations. It caters mostly to small businesses, but is open to all Costco members. If you need something in bulk but the regular Costco is not big enough (I know this sounds crazy right) then you have found the right place. For example, do you need 25 pounds of pepperoni or half of a lamb? But it is also great if you want to get meat or fruit for a party. The prices seem about the same or slightly lower per ounce/unit than the typical Costco. \n\nAlso, the staff was very friendly and helpful. They are happy to answer any questions you might have and if you need help finding something they will personally walk you over to it, rather than point and leave you to find it yourself. \n\nThis location is worth a stop if you are in the area or if you are hosting a large gathering.	4
	2066	I got free shipping on an order I placed with Urban Outfitters and had no idea until it had shipped they were using a carrier I never heard of. \n\nFast forward to the day of delivery I monitor the tracking status and even get home from work to see it hasn't been delivered yet. I wait around, even periodically looking out the window to see if the driver is outside, and still no package. I check the status online again and it says it was delivered at a specific time, which strangely enough, 7 minutes after that I had a knock at a door of a person handing me a flyer, thinking its my package. \n\nI never had another knock at the door, so either the driver delivered it to the wrong address, or it was stolen within a 7 min time frame of when it was supposedly left at my front door to when I had someone else knock at my door. I called OnTrac to tell them I haven't received my package and they inform me they will page the driver to come back and help me locate my package. I wait and hour and a half and still haven't heard back, I called OnTrac again and get a different woman who informs me she paged the driver and was able to get ahold of him but he was already home but will come back out tomorrow and help me locate my package which is not what the first woman told me. \n\nThis is the WORST experience I've ever had with an order, even USPS hasn't been this horrible. Terrible customer service and drivers who either do not knock on the door or deliver to the wrong address.	0
	2067	Beyond the fact that I like their green milk tea and rose milk tea, I have nothing good to say about this place.  Service, as everyone else on here seems to agree, is HORRIBLE!! I don't know why I even bother tipping (when eat in) anymore.  I usually tip a very small % because the service is THAT bad.  Now that I think about it, they charge over $6 for a large drink (!!!!) and add so much ice, I shouldn't have to tip.  If I ever go back and actually sit down to enjoy my drink, I will not be leaving a tip. \n\nAnd another thing that have intrigued me for a long time is that, every time we go get a beverage to go (I order the same thing every time), they charge me differently.  I don't get it.  How can the same drink be priced differently each time?  My boyfriend thinks it's because he's non-Asian and they think they can rip him off because he's white.  I don't know how true that is but it is quite strange, don't you think?	0
	2068	This is an update on the deli .... Dear deli you suck your help is incompetent and slow I have passed up shopping in your deli because of the help you hire	0
	2069	WASTE OF MONEY!!! Don't be woo'd by the three Michelin starts. The food was mediocre at best and the portions were tiny. The service was good enough, but even our waiter didn't seem to be too excited by the menu when we asked for recommendations on specific dishes. You would be better off throwing all you money on the green zero at a roulette table. At least then you would know you were throwing your money away.	0
	2070	picked a dress.  ANN... YOU ARE AMAZING!!!\n\nthanks for being awesome!  the patience of a saint.  Seriously, if you a curvy girl, and you do not visit here, you are doing yourself a diservice.  AND... if you think their prices are out of range, they are NOT...  They are right on par with Davids Bridal, but are much better quality AND much more original gowns/dresses.  \n\nI am so thankful to have found this place.	4
	2071	FINALLY tried banh mi, and it was really good!\nThe place was empty at 6:00 on a Thursday evening (literally, we were the only ones in there), so we got our sandwiches pretty quick. \nI ordered the bbq pork banh mi for ~$3.75 and my husband got the 'european' roast beef for ~$5.75. First off, I would not order any of the 'European' sandwiches because they come with very little meat and American (!) cheese. Definitely not worth the higher price. However, I really enjoyed my banh mi, and would definitely go back for the lunch special (includes 2 mini egg rolls and a drink for like $5.50). The baguettes were really good and the meat was not too fatty (which is the problem I usually have with Asian meats). \nThe inside of the shop is really clean - like a modern-style fast food joint. The drink selection is pretty good; typical fountain drinks, plus a couple big coolers full of Asian sodas/bottled coffees/teas.\nMinus points for filling the fountain sodas in the back and not offering free refills - this is 2013!\nWeird note: it's actually cheaper to get the combo (with side and drink) than it is to just get the sandwich and a side....	3
	2072	We went here with a work function. There were about 12 of us so we got the use of half of a private room, the other half was being used by another group. \n\nI got the chorizo sandwich with a cup of tortilla soup. The sandwich was good but very messy and very greasy. The soup I thought was very good. \n\nThe highlight of the meal to me was the salsa and queso. The queso comes with a little tealight to keep it warm. If that tealight goes out have someone re-light it soon, because the queso will become thick and not easy to eat once it gets cold. \n\nOverall a great place for some Mexican, but I think I would rather go to a more authentic restaurant.	3
	2073	Fun environment. Pleasant service. Food is great. Some of the bruschetta combinations stretch toward being pretentious.  Overall a great find for the weary traveler.	3
	2074	Whenever I show up to Vegas with the girlfriend and if we stay for at least two nights, I always try to go to an upscale steakhouse. This recent trip to Vegas a few weeks ago was no different.\n\nI'm not sure how other reviewers are saying that you can't make a reservation through OpenTable but I did and just to be sure called to confirm. Just to be triple-sure I showed up to Paris a day early to ask about the reservation and the hostess (though she didn't seem too friendly) confirmed it as well. So a big YES you can make reservations through OpenTable and it will be honored.\n\nWhen we showed up, we didn't wait long before being seated (we were about 10 minutes early). \n\nIf you are coming here for an intimate dinner, you might want to look elsewhere. The way the restaurant is set up (at least on the bottom floor) is done so that you are literally one-arm's-length from the table next to you; which to me is a little too close for comfort. \n\nLike Cut, they will show you examples of the various steaks available and the impressive marbling on each. We settled on a side of spinach, 1x bone-in ribeye and 1x beef wellington - both medium rare.\n\nThe food: the spinach was so-so for me, and the beef wellington, while excellent, all paled in comparison to the rib-eye, which was absolutely tender, delicious, and just about melted in your mouth.\n\nHaving been to several of these kinds of steakhouses over the years it really comes down to three things: Service, Ambiance, and Food. While Gordon Ramsey Steak does an excellent job with the Service and Food aspect, I wasn't terribly  impressed with the ambiance. While it's definitely nice inside, it's not really meant for a romantic setting between you and a significant other.\n\nHowever, with a ribeye this good this place definitely is worth another try sometime in the future.	3
	2075	One of the best sushi places in the Awathukee area! Love the gyozas and the rainbow roll! The staff is also extremely nice and polite. Have to love this place!	3
	2076	I love KFC food, but not the service at this location. The manager told my boyfriend & I in a very bossy way (right as we were handing him our money) that 'our order is to-go' at 9:30 because they were closed. The sign on the door said they closed at 10. I was soooo mad!	1
	2077	Great fish. Everything else pretty much a disaster. Service juvenile. Hours for follow up on simple asks. Ran out of unfiltered saki at 7:30pm. Give them a year to pull it together.	1
	2078	"I'm not digging it. Yes, the atmosphere might be fun, but the cupcakes weren't to my expectations. Dry \""cake\"", generic/ processed frosting, and overall not a super good experience."	1
	2079	One to two stars, got the Jambalaya:\n\nMarinated chicken, white rice, andouille sausage, sweet peppers and roasted green onions in a spicy traditional jambalaya sauce\n\nWasn't:\nSpicy\nEvenly Heated\n\nHad:\nDelicious sauce\nA lot of Rice\n\n*Even BJs has a better Jambalaya with more stuff.\n\nWaiter was nice, split all the checks for us, she asked. (A party of 12)	0
	2080	This place is nothing special! Breakfast is the easiest meal to cook, and when I pay for it I want it to be flippin awesome. This was just ok - like Dennys. \n\nThe place was packed, but it only took a minute to be seated. The service was all around good - no complaints.\n\nI ordered one of the skillets - maybe the three meats - which was okay. It was fresh, good portion, and tasted ok. Just nothing to write home about. The best thing, other than the diet coke, was the banana bread. \n\nIt's not bad, just not good. Make your own breakfast, and you'll be just as happy.	2
	2081	if you need a korean food fix in vegas like i do, this is the place to go!  prices aren't overly priced and the side dishes are plentiful.  the food was delicious and it just what my friends and i needed before our private poker tourney at mandalay bay.\n\nservice?  definitely better than most korean places.. anywhere.  lol.  if you've frequented korean restaurants, you know exactly what i mean.\n\ndefinitely will be eating here again on our next trip out to vegas!	3
	2082	"Blizz Frozen Yogurt is a disaster. We woke up early in the morning, and finally made it here, to find a small line. When it was my turn to order, the person the register, was very rude, and did not let me order what I wanted. On top of that, I had to shell out $13 just to get a crepe. We sat down, and waited 1/2 hour just to be told, \""oh, your next.\""\nDon't come to this awful place, save some money and go anywhere else."	0
	2083	This is one of the many MGM-Mirage properties on the strip.  The casino and hotel staff are all welcoming and friendly.   The casino floor and selection of shops and eateries is  decent and complete.\n\nThe casino floor and shops are all looking very nice with the New York theme design and  layout (Obviously very well maintained). The hotel rooms, however, are starting to look a little dated and might be due for updating (My room had a tube TV, which seems like a ancient relic now in 2009 - especially for a large, reputable, mid-strip property).	2
	2084	Good food, good service, nice decor... I'm having trouble thinking of any bad things to say about this place.\n\nLocated off the strip near the Hard Rock Hotel, Bahama Breeze was a delightful place from beginning to end.\n\nOur server was friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Seafood Paella without the sausage, which our server said could be done.  One of the chefs came out a few moments later and said that the paella was made with the sausage in it and that they would be picking it out, which was fine with me so long as there wasn't any sausage actually on my plate.  I really appreciate this gesture because I know that not a lot of vegetarians would be cool with that.  When it came, I devoured it, which wasn't easy because it was a big plate of food.\n\nMy wife had the Fresh Pan-Seared Salmon Pasta, which was also amazing!\n\nWe had a couple of their specialty mixed drinks, which are not on the on-line menu so I don't recall the names.  But they were also very tasty.\n\nSeems to me like most of the good food in Vegas is off the strip, and this would be a perfect example.  \n\nWe shall return!	4
	2085	I'm having a hard time deciding whether to give it a 2 or a 3. I gave Stack'd a 4, and Stack'd is tied for my favorite place around Walnut Street (I only give 5's to fancy places with food that I'll never forget). So I really don't feel like giving this place only one point below Stack'd.\n\nI went to Stack'd yesterday for the Tuesday burger special and they had these fliers that said The Ave has Wednesday burger specials, so I thought I'd try it out. It's 3.5 dollars for a burger and a bunch of fries. That's awesome, right?\n\nTurns out, I'm having a very hard time believing that this place has the same owner as Stack'd. Stack'd makes great burgers, and considering that they're only 3 dollars on Tuesdays, it's really awesome. Burgers here are totally different, they taste completely different and overly salty. Also, I just realized today that yes, people can mess up fries.\n\nSo in terms of food quality, it's really meh. But maybe it's just this one burger and fries that they don't do well.\n\nMost of the reviews here are talking about cheesesteaks, but they deleted that from the menu completely. They switched from making custom cheesesteaks to burgers and sandwiches some time ago because as they said, their cheesesteaks weren't selling that good. I've never got a chance to get their cheesesteaks, but I really feel that it was a bad choice. Pittsburgh doesn't have a lot of cheesesteak places, and there definitely ain't any good places around. They would have easily created a monopoly if they just waited some time for the reputation to start spreading.\n\nAlso, I had a very long wait for my burger today. This place is half empty, even on its half price burger night. I really didn't have a lot of competition in waiting for my food, but it took around 40 minutes. Usually Stack'd takes less than 10 minutes when there are this many people in the bar. This is almost the waiting time for Stack'd at its Tuesday peak.\n\nI'm only debating giving this place a 3 because I like the atmosphere (which is pretty much a duplicate of Stack'd). They have TVs everywhere possible and that's awesome. I love watching 5 sports shows at once, but I don't think I'll be back, even on Wednesdays.	1
	2086	I own and operate a mobile DJ company. MC Audio is my GO TO place for all of my gear needs. These guys not only know their stuff, but have great customer support and top notch pricing. I've never been anything less that totally happy with my purchases there, and I've spent thousands of dollars on speakers, controllers, lights and more. \n\nDO NOT buy at guitar center or even amazon until you give these guys a chance to beat the price. I've never even had to ask and the prices always come in less than others.	4
	2087	Had dinner there on 7/31/2010. Sadly disapointed with the food. The atmosphere was nice and service was average. I recommend the mussels for an appetizer. We ordered the Filet mignon which is probably one of the easiest meat to cook....was very dry......the Hand made cavatelli was not that great...the blue crab in it hardly had any flavor and was swimming in cream sauce that was quite boring. Again quite a disappointment (if you actually like food and not just there for the ambiance) since he's supposed to be one of the better chefs around..Will probably not go back or recommend...tsk tsk tsk	1
	2088	This place is awesome great quality and customer service this place came from my home town in grantspass Oregon same as I remember it	4
	2089	We have always loved this place! This has always been our go to place when here for the National Final's Rodeo. We have always recommended this restaurant to all our friends coming to Vegas! We have always made our reservations for Tuesday night because it's 2 for 1...but we were very disappointed tonight. Apparently only locals are encouraged to come on Tuesdays because you have to be a local to get 2 for 1 on Tuesday. I really don't understand this concept and never heard of any restaurant having this policy. Our bill was $270 for 7 people and of course we were expecting it to be half of that. I spoke to the manager after we received the bill and she explained this was their new policy. She did deduct $20. I'm still very disappointed that a business wants to serve locals differently than anyone who walks through their doors.	1
	2090	I heard there was an Old Navy outlet here so I was very excited to come check it out. I live in Greensboro so it's about an hour from me. Concord Mill itself is pretty decent. A lot of stores, big food court,  and a movie theater are included here, but the old navy store is definitely not an outlet. Certain things are on sale but not the entire store. They may have more sales going on but I'm not considering them an outlet.	2
	2091	I go here regularly for their Pad Thai or their Chicken Lo Mein. The food is consistently pretty good. But aside from one nice person I know personally, their staff is often unfriendly. I usually just order take-out because of the vibe.	2
	2092	Had lunch around 1:30 pm today. My dilemma-all our food selections were very good. She Crab soup, iceberg wedge, tuna salad sandwich&fish sandwich. All were flavorful and very attractively priced. Service leaves a lot to be desired. Extremely long wait for food, drinks, however, came quickly. Waited for check as well. The restaurant was not crowded. Good food at nice price, just a heads up on the speed for it to be delivered. \nEasily a 4 star rating if service was better.	2
	2093	Start off by saying the food was AMAZING! You start with chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants. The salsa was really good! I also got the house margarita, also really good. Not your premix margarita, this tasted freshly made!\nI had 2 tacos. A paco taco and smokey & the brisket. Oh my so delicious! You could taste the smoke in the brisket! I liked the smokey & the brisket a little better because it had a fresh tomato salsa that made the taco very refreshing. \nMy husband had the open face pork quesadilla. He would not stop raving about how good they were. \nThe services was fantastic! We made a reservation and did not have to wait on a Saturday night at 730. Our waiter was also really friendly as well. \nWe will definitely be eating here again!	4
	2094	"I felt that the doctor, Joe Sharkus, did not explain very much to me. He spoke in esoteric terms and left the room immediately after procedures asking the assistant to explain procedures and process for him. Worst yet, I was originally quoted at 600 dollars which seemed right considering my insurance but after the procedure, mouth numb, they handed me a bill for 1100 dollars.  They had little explanation for why the bill changed so drastically. The receptionist said something like, \""looks like your plan was downgraded.\"" Later I found out through my insurance company that that was simply not true. I had not been downgraded just misled. They originally quoted me for one kind of filling my insurance took but then filled my mouth with a different kind my insurance did not take. It all was perfectly legal and in the tiny fine print but I think completely unethical. I can't afford those kinds of bills so I have had to go through a 3rd party payment plan to pay it off. I would not recommend him or that office."	0
	2095	Thus far, I've had nothing but good service from these guys.  They've gotten me in for oil changes on a moments notice (a far cry from even being able to schedule pre-paid oil changes at Fletcher's) and not only corrected a bad alignment from Fletcher's, but also adjusted to a proper manual setting for better tire wear (at my request).  They've been good every time I've dealt with them and have had no issues with me watching over their shoulders sometimes as they do their work.	3
	2096	The best burger i've ever had. It is amazing. Might as well name it Build-A-Burger. The service was good and the amount of food is great. I have nothing bad to say about the burger. I will come here again when I make my visit to vegas.	4
	2097	"For a first time \""tanner\"", I had a great experience!!! Never thought I'd see myself with an even tan!!!! Can't wait to go back for my next round!!!! I'll be summer ready before the summer even gets here!!! I luv it!"	3
	2098	I really wanted to like this place... My partner and I were thrilled to see a Mediterranean Buffet open in Central Phoenix... a food type that has been sadly overlooked in this part of town.  We saw the sign and went in hoping for the best.\n\nWe were the only customers, though another couple did come in, look at the buffet, and leave.  The food was mediocre, but I do have to say the potatoes and the tabouleh were both very good.  Most of the other food looked like leftovers from lunch or the day before.  \n\nOwners - if you are reading this, you still have some great potential with this place.  Here is what you have to do if you want my business again:\n1- Get rid of the Asian Decor and invest in actually making the place LOOK like the Mediterranean place you want to be.  For a few thousand dollars, you could make this place look really cool\n\n2- Don't worry about filling up all four of the buffets.  Why not close down two of them and focus on putting out half the food - but make it REALLY good!  That would cut down on your food waste and get people excited about your food\n\n3- Sorry, but Naan, curries, and other Indian delights are not Mediterranean.  Just leave them off.  Did I see burritos on the buffet as well?  Really now!\n\n4 - I want to like this place, consider closing for a week and redecorate, redesign the menu on the buffet, and try again.  Unfortunately, like it is right now I don't think  you will see us back any time soon.	0

	2100	The location itself is pretty cool. The open dining room makes watching any sporting event a group activity (with all the other strangers in the bar).\n\nOverall, the food is ok; the only vegetarian option is the black bean burger, which was a little dry.\n\nTypically, service is pretty good and we have a good time when we go.	2
