0	OK, so hear it goes.  Rudy's is new in the West Valley (I-10 & Litchfield Rd.)  I have had friends tell me about it so I wanted to try it.  The place was pretty packed, it was a short wait in a good sized line to get to the food counter.  Once there they will ask you if you have been there before.  If not, they will offer you tastings of the meats and explain the serving to you. There may be several new comers so you will have to deal will people who want to try everything because they don't know what they want. That is irritating but expected.  As it was our first time at Rudy's we wanted to try several items.  We ordered Cutter's Brisket, Turkey, regular Sausage, Rudy's pinto beans, green chili, potato salad, coleslaw & a micro brew bottle beer. They have plenty of beer and beverage choices. Everything was good but the stand out for me was the Turkey.  Get the Turkey! it had excellent flavor and smokiness while remaining moist and tender.  The brisket was dry and not as flavorful. The beans were good but not great. I like great beans. the Coleslaw was very good. The potato salad was my least favorite.  The sausage was huge and it had great flavor.  They offer their brand of BBQ sauce in Sissy or Original (a bit more spicy).  I compare this place to Texas BBQ House, where the brisket is much more flavorful and moist. They do not offer Turkey however. I also like the flavor and consistency of Texas BBQ House's BBQ sauce much better.  Rudy's was good, not a negative experience, I just had higher hopes for a full flavor of brisket I get elsewhere. I prefer Texas BBQ House over Rudy's.  Give Rudy's a try and see what you think.	2
1	The price was right and the suite was amazing. If you want true 5 star i am not sure las vegas even offers it.... Just keep that in mind. Someone posted disappointment that the service was not 5 star and they were actually correct, but the people are nice and helpful, so that has its own value coupled with the views, etc.	3
2	Get the steak and cheese sub with mushrooms	4
3	My friend told me about a secret pizza place I should definitely hit up while on vacation in Vegas, and am I glad I did.  The same night I arrived, my girlfriend and I decided to take a stroll in the Cosmopolitan hotel and went up to the third floor to search for the hallway my friend tipped me about.  Just as my friend mentioned, the smell of pizza overpowered my senses and everything looked delicious.  I decided to go with a slice of cheese and pepperoni while my girlfriend went with the white pizza with mushrooms.  Upon the first couple bites, the pizza was absolutely delicious.  The thing that really put me over was the crust.  The crust was perfectly crunchy and tasty.  I will have to say that this place takes my favorite small pizza spot back in Houston simply because of the crust.  Although it is a couple dollars more than the slices back home, I will consider this pretty cheap knowing that i would spend over $80 for my girlfriend and I had we ate in one of the restaurants next door.  For this, I will have to say this is the best pizza I have had, at least from a smaller/not-too-fancy pizzeria.  We went back to eat here the next night too! Go get you some!	4
4	Located near Metals Edge Studios, this place has been deceptively hidden from me.\n\nI went there tonight for the first time with some people from a networking group and at first was a bit put off.\n\nIt's a bit more bar with the seating style indoors, which was where we chose to sit. There is also outdoor seating with tables and chairs. It was a slow night. We had fast, friendly and efficient service. Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating to those who needed different types of seating, etc, because of the really high chairs.\n\nI was expecting crappy bar food and though I was not a fan of the nachos (chicken was a bit bland) or the calamari (tasted like they were frozen...plus, they looked like onions rings at first glance), I was very happy with other items on the menu.\n\nI was a big fan of the complimentary beef taquitos and the chicken fingers that the owner, Flicka, himself sent out....and delivered as well.\n\nThe food was priced cheaply and the menu was easy to read. There isn't a huge variety of food to choose from, but there is definitely enough there to satisfy the most finicky eater. Coronas are $2.00, nachos with chicken was a scant $6.75...it was such a bargain!\n\nThe owner, Flicka, came and chatted with us a couple of times. At first we wondered who this man was, but he was completely affable and so sincere how could we not enjoy him talking to us?\n\nI enjoyed it here, but it's a bit out of the way. It's really bar more than a cantina. The food is decent and the atmosphere leaves a bit more to be desired. Overall, I'd come here again if someone else were driving.	3
5	***Dinner buffet review***\nReasonable price for nice variety including crabs and prime rib\n\nSo my husband and I are very much buffet fanatics when visiting Vegas.  We usually end up going to buffet at least once a day.  \n\nWe always loved Bellagio buffet and have been here several times.  It has a great mix of pretty much what you expect in a buffet.  Considering price, food choices (seafood included), ambiance, it is a solid 4 stars.\n\n* Food:  \n- Snow and King crabs = cut in half and COLD.  The best thing about the crabs here is that they have plenty of them out so you won't have to stand in line for so long.  (HINT:  Snow crabs are actually more tasty than the King crabs...I know, it's werid)\n\n- Prime Rib = very yummy, very fast line.\n\n* Price: $29.95/person (Thursday night)\n\n* Ambiance = typical casino buffet.  Very nice but not so nice that you feel awkward carrying a plate full of crab legs and melted butter.  \n\n* Service = Very attentive.  No need to ask for refills or taking away dirty dishes.	3
6	We started out really excited to go to this place, but left feeling sort of deflated about the customer service. \n\nThe decor looked great, background music was a nice indie blend and the place was clean.\n\nWhen I asked our waitress about the beer selection and that I primarily prefer belgian and wheat ales, she said she couldn't really help me because she only liked hoppy beers since she started working there. She didn't tell me about any of the guest ales on tap (there was an Orange Blossom) or to even help to explain about any of the house beers that would have a low IBU (International Bitterness Units). So I ordered the house root beer. Not bad.\n\nWe ordered a pizza for dinner and it was pretty good, but then we waited and waited for the waitress to come around and ask us if we wanted dessert (we did), but she brought us the check (on a slow night with about 12 people in the restaurant) and left before we could even ask her about the desserts. My husband had to go over to the dessert case to get the owner to order our dessert for us. And the tiramisu was really lacking.\n\nBottom line: For a brewery/restaurant that has been open for more than a few months, I expect better service and consistency than this. Get it together.\n\nParent Perspective: Two high chairs available (that I saw), two items for the kids' menu and no changing table in the bathroom.	1
7	"Gonna give it another shot.\n\nIt was a Tuesday morning.  I got up late and was running waaaaay behind schedule.  I needed something quick to eat on the way to a morning meeting, so pulled up the handy Yelp mobile app and found this spot just a stone's throw away.  \n\nI walked in and the first thing that hits me is: \""What the hell is a 'bialy?'\""  Fortunately, an employee was there to help me understand that a bialy is baked and a bagel is boiled.  So: it's the texture, not the stuffing.  I decide to get one of each toasted with no spreads.  \n\nI think I spent less than $1.50, but I don't remember the exact amount.  Regardless, it was a small price to pay for some delicious culinary research.  In my ever so humble opinion, I like the texture of bagels compared to the bialy.  Taste-wise, they were both much yummier than that nationwide chain you always see on every corner.\n\nI only went here to grab a quick breakfast, but they have different options that I would love to come back for and give another shot."	2
8	I had the chance to try this place the other day on UNLV  campus. I ordered the Bloody Bay and it was so yummy!\n\nPrices weren't too bad and service was quick! Definitely, going back to try some of the loaded waffle fries!	3
9	I ordered the garlic chicken dinner special, so good, they packed the take out container, it was so much food! Saved half for later :)	4
10	This place is amazing. It has its own vibe that draws just the right crowd of misfit artists. You wont find a better place to spend an evening among art and artists.	4
11	We had an amazing meal here...granted it was 3 years ago. Had a spicy shrimp dish and it was so delicious. Service was wonderful as was atmosphere. Both my husband and I still talk about the amazing Mexican meal we had here. Give it a try....	3
12	Good stuff.  Unusual, for me anyway, but always enjoy trying something different.\nI've never ordered anything from here but what they have on the shelves has been tasty and fresh.\nWe've had breakfast or lunch her on a few occasions and that's good.  Nothing fancy though.\nOne thing about this place is it's very small.  Like maybe two tables that seat four and maybe a two top too.	3
13	"Blech.  Don't be fooled by all of the signs advertising a $6.95 \""gamblers breakfast\"".  When you open the menu you will see that it is actually $8.50 unless you hold a Binions card.\n\nEven at the lower rate it wouldn't be worth it.  Potatoes were sent back because they were too cold.  Scrambled eggs weren't very scrambled.  Bacon paper thin, sausage patti small.  \n\nOne star breakfast.  Two stars because the service was decent."	1
14	Ordered a hot sandwich......and 28 minutes later and after asking 3x's I finally got it.  Way to long to have to wait for lunch.	0
15	"What a huge disappointment on all levels. From the moment we sat down I could see the level of filth between the banquets. Our service was poor, uninformed and slow to the point of feeling ignored. Our server could not explain the signature cocktail saying \""I think it has gin in it\"" The food was just fair and in fact, the frites were served cold and limp. We were asked upon making the reservation if this was a special occasion. We said yes, it was my birthday. Our server did acknowledge my birthday but never offered dessert to our table. No one stopped by the table at any time to ask how our meal was and frankly, it's a good thing or I would have let them have it. I would say it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. Don't waste your time or your money on this place."	0
16	Major disappointment. \n\nI've visited a handful of different LA Fitness' locations in the valley and this is BY FAR the worst one I've been to.  I consider LA Fitness to be a pretty solid chain gym and this location is simply not up to par . The gym is small and the equipment appears outdated.  Needless to say I probably won't be returning if I happen to be in the area.	0
17	I cannot believe this.  I lived in Chandler for eleven years and never discovered this place until I moved to Tempe for college.  Either way, it's a blessing to the earth.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)\n\n+ Coffee is fresh and never burnt.  I drink lots and lots of this drug, I know what's up.\n\n-/+ Lots of places to sit, but I just can't get comfortable.  It's too bright inside and the music outside is usually too loud.  However...\n\n+ The joint is located on a lake (man-made of course) and it's beautiful.  Once a friend and I passed on the tables and just sat on the edge of the water. Despite the dead fish smell, which wasn't harsh, it was fantastic.\n\n+ The employees always ask how you are doing.  They are quick to make drinks and never get distracted.\n\n+ Prices are below average.  There are a few items that are a tad overpriced, but in a nutshell this is the place to get an inexpensive good time.\n\n+  PUNCH CARD!! As some of you know, I really like punch cards.  Coffee Rush has them.  Get one.	3
18	Insanely expensive. Average like any good sushi bar and the palazzo in my opinion is pretty plain. \n\nIf it's sushi you seek the OSAKA sushi restaurant on Sahara will blow you away. \n\nThere's a lot better places than this one. Pass.	2
19	I've been here a few times now for the unlimited sushi deal.  It's pretty easy to get your money's worth.  However, like most places on campus, the sushi just isn't that good.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad.  There's only one roll I've had here which I didn't like, and that's not because it was poorly made or anything; I just didn't like the flavor (the Texas Scorpion, in case you're wondering).  I tend to prefer fancy rolls, but most of the specialty rolls here are pretty similar, and I'd prefer some variety.\n\nI always get a ton of yellowtail when I go, though.  It's pretty tasty.	2
20	I found Cornerstone on Yelp after recently moving to Las Vegas. I have to say that the previous reviewers were correct--Cornerstone Furniture is great. After the move, my husband and I were in need of many pieces of furniture. I went to check the store out, to see if it would be worth it to bring my husband back (he doesn't normally like furniture shopping). I had a great experience with Rafael who let me spent a lot of time exploring the inventory in a no-pressure way. I told him that I would bring my husband back when we were ready to purchase. I went back today, and we had a blast working with Rafael! He was honest and genuine, and really helpful. The best part was there was very little pressure to buy anything. He just kept telling us to take our time. Not only is there a large amount of furniture on the floor, but he also has tons of catalogs, and can order just about anything! We purchased some items today, but we'll be back to get more! Even my husband enjoyed the process, and had a smile on his face.	4
21	"What is that syndrome called where you begin to identify with your kidnapper? Well that is how the relationship between the Sand Convention center and I has progressed. Last year, I felt like a rat trapped in the toilet, this past trip I was more \""accepting\"" of the convention centers drawbacks.\nA note to all attending shows here. When they say they have multiple levels of convention space, what they really mean is they have a few great, spacious, luxurious ballrooms and convention halls, then they have two levels concrete, bomb shelter type parking garage that is used to house booths for large conventions. \nThat being said, the staff has done a good job here of making the venue as easy as possible to navigate and get thru. I have been to many a convention center and I would say that the Sands puts on a slightly above average venue. Getting in and getting out this year went better than last, but the place is still a maze. \nIf you see the minotaur just run...run........RUN!"	2
22	Very good food! I tried it after the article about 21 best sandwiches in Phoenix. The Reuben was good, but looked nothing like the picture. Great place to enjoy a great AZ day	3
23	"3.5 stars. the bf LOVES this place and kept recommending it \""it's so delicious; best, super authentic beef noodle soup; my friends and i all love it \"" but then again - what does he know? \n\nservice is average. food is expensive for chinese, but cheap for vegas. szechwan beef noodle soup is actually surprisingly awesome and i'd give that ONE dish a 5.... but all the rest is maybe a 2.5/ 3.... tea bags for the tea, sad grayish siu mai... and the kimchi is good, but $$$. \n\nstick to the szechwan beef noodle soup!!\n\n7/30 yelp challenge"	2
24	This gym offers a great selection of classes; however, there are more negatives than positives with this gym. Parking is difficult to come by, and you have to pay. The staff is not so friendly, it's expensive for the quality of equipment, and I wish someone was sitting at the desk downstairs instead of upstairs. \n\nI can't wait for my contract to end; I regret signing one now. There has to be better gyms in the area.	1
25	This place has gone down hill. I stayed here many times in the past and the service was always great before. We checked in for two nights and we are leaving after midnight the first night to stay somewhere else. The room next door had over 40 people drunk, screaming, and jumping around in the room and the hallway. We called security many times and nothing!  We have spent a lot of money here in the past but never again. It reminded me of a cheap Motel 6! Stay away!	0
26	"This place is a piece of shit. There were no other customers there except for a big group that seemed to be friends with the workers there. We waited 15 minutes until I got up to tell a server to come take our order. He said \""I'll be with you in a minute\"" and was standing there doing nothing. My party and I decided to get out of that shithole. On the way out, I see 3 other employees sitting and chatting with the customers from the other tables. Fuck this place."	0
27	A big fat disappointment.\n\nAnd I say this without having to wait in a ridiculous 3 hour line. We were seated right away, thanks to TR Diamond perks. The food? Gross. 2 stars for the crab legs and oysters ONLY...but come on, how do you screw that up?\n\nI still prefer Wicked Spoon, although they lack the oysters, the selection is quality, not quantity!	1
28	"I still have lukewarm feelings about this place.  It isn't the warm place you go to, to feel loved and like they know you.  I've only been here twice and I don't think anyone here is entertained by my (what I believe to be) witty comments.\n\nIt's a little intimidating at first because I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb.  I'm not one to be flashy or necessarily into the beauty aspect of my looks so I generally tend to feel out of place at salons anyway, let along a salon where everyone where's black.  \n\nThe receptionist has always been nice, although not one to engage in small talk or humoring a \""smart\"" patron such as myself.  She's a busy bee so I'll let her off the hook.  I like the fact that she seems to be a hard worker.\n\nTechnical: 5 stars on my eyebrow job.  I felt like a new woman.  I've never had my eyebrows waxed before but because I've always been afraid that I would have to draw them in (*ahem* not that there's anything wrong with that, I guess) but damn it, Kim (?) did a great job.  I will definitely be going back once they get a little too bushy to handle...\n\nOkay, so I do watch Tabitha's Salon Make-Over or whatever that show is called.  And I do think that their wax pot needs some cleaning.  I'll have to do a little more investigation on that the next time I go.  Update to come up in about a month.\n\nI haven't had any other service from Polished... Shortly after I went the second time, I got an e-mail saying they let 8 girls go and I was wondering if that was a response to my not making appointments.  But seeing as a couple of the other patrons on yelp say that they've had to wait long periods, I will do everyone a favor and start making appointments."	2
29	Sorry wish I could rate the food, but three strikes and you're out. Tried to order online through the app and it wouldn't work (kept asking me to agree to the terms but there was no where to select that) then tried calling, couldn't get them to answer. Then just showed up at the store and waited five minutes but couldn't place our order and we noticed the in store prices were different then the pricing online. Didn't know ordering a pizza would be such an ordeal. So were taking this as a sign that the pizza Gods are intervening and we shouldn't have a pizza tonight. Probably will give papa johns our business tonight instead.	0
30	great mixology drinks very creative,  look for Groupon 2 for 1 drinks, good atmosphere, i would recommend if you are downtown and just wanted to hangout and listen to some breakin beats	4
31	Hurry in and try this Ginger Cinnamon Latte!! I added carmel sauce and soy milk over ice in their large, a whopping 32oz size, Delish!! The flavor combination was amazing! I would drive out of my way any day for this place. \n\nTucked behind Fox and Hound Pub & Grill this coffee shop is small, but warm and inviting. The staff was very helpful and friendly, my barista even asked me to try this unusual concoction, upon pickup, to make sure I liked it. I was in love! I may have found my new coffee stop. \n\nComparable to *bucks pricing but has a much truer taste without the burnt espresso taste = worth it! They also have a convenient drive up window. (Yay! now I can pickup this coffee goodness in my pjs!)	4
32	I have passed by this place for years and always promised myself I would give it a try sometime.  so last week having some free time I decided to have lunch there.\nI had the jerk chicken with rice and the plantains.  The chicken was tender and tasted ok but nothing to get excited over.  I enjoyed the rice with red beans,\nI wish they had a soda fountain as I do not like paying a buck fifty for a can of soda. \n  They did give me a little extra for free however.  About 2 hours after a dined, my stomach began to rumble and I spent the next 36 hours carving  a path between my bed and the bathroom.  Needles to say I am now ruined for Caribbean Spice and probably jerk chicken also.	1
33	Waited 20 minutes for our table on a Friday night, no problem. The service was fine, it was the food that makes me give a 2 stars. The Tortilla soup was the best thing we ordered. I had the carne asada tacos, the meat was dried out, lacked the onions and cilantro that these tacos should have, plus they were at room temperature. As well were my rice & beans, and the beans were very bland. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the fajitas, the meat was hot, but the tortillas were stale and the rice & beans were room temperature as well.	1
34	Within Teviot there are a number of bars and the most popular has to be the Library bar. It only came into existence a couple of years ago when it was decided that Teviot needed a new classy bar. Since it was open I have to say it has become one of my favourite student union bars.\n\nSpread over two levels, with a spiral staircase connecting the two, the Library Bar has a rustic, old library look with a slightly more modern looking bar. The majority of the bar is dominated by dark wood furnishings and many, many books in the glass cabinets. \n\nThe bar opens really at midday when you can order lunch, food is then served till quite late at night. The food is good for a student bar, but at times, service has been slow and sometimes the food has not been as hot as it should be! \n\nHowever, apart from that drinks are at student prices and additionally you can order cocktails which are slightly more expensive. The bar has acoustic open mic nights, a quiz night and you can play board games, ranging from Risk to Trivial Pursuit!\n\nThis bar is always lively during semester time and does not disappoint!	3
35	I drove 45 minutes to get here. The place was chinatown cute and the menu looked bomb but the service was SKIMPY. They were nice enough but they seat you,, get your drinks/food to you and that's IT. We aren't high maintenance so it wasn't a big deal for us but I can see this being an issue for others. \n\n3 of us got soups with different width noodles. I ordered the same type of noodles as my husband but when received, my noodles looked at least twice the width as his. The broth was ho hum just not enough of a savory type flavor and the noodles bland and tasted doughy. There were a couple things that were good (like the potstickers YUM, teriyaki chicken, fried tofu) but the general feeling at the table was an ehhhhhhhh :/\n\nMy  family politely chatted about maybe trying other items next time but I felt like there was alot of disappointment around the table (not to mention leftovers that no one wanted to take home).\n\nYelp-You totally let me down on this one :(	1
36	DON'T GO HERE!!! I went to see Dr. Carrie Cashman, after finding a lump in my breast. I had already had a hand test and ultrasound at other places. I had my appointment and was told NOTHING that I didn't already know, after waiting almost 2 hours to see the doctor and I arrived early. She made a guess at what she thought it was and gave me my options, biopsy, surgery if it's cancerous etc. Already was told that but ok. I asked for the prices of removal which she then proceeded to give me phone numbers and told me to call them and ask, really they can't even call for me? But ok, let it go. Finally I go to pay, told them I didn't have insurance and would be paying out of pocket, she told me it was 130, I paid and left, nothing else was said. It's been a month and I just got a bill in the mail for 115 dollars from them! They did not once say the appointment was 243 and they'd be splitting it up or absolutely anything of the sort! They are literally trying to steal my money and have done absolutely nothing! If I could give them 0 stars I would. I will not be having my surgery done through this business.	0
37	I hesitate to write a true review for this place as I have only been there for the grand opening.  I'm not sure if the free food buffet they had was a true sample of their menu or not.  I was impressed by the variety of food they had available, most notably the Teriyaki beef which is among the best I have ever tasted.  Growing up in Hawaii this is no small feat... I used to live off of the stuff.  They also had some interesting drinks available at the bar, including a sparkling sake beer (that is the only way I can think to describe it) that was quite addicting.	3
38	"Never been to a Boston Market?  \n\nThey basically have roasted chicken and a variety of sides.  You go up to the front counter and choose what to eat - it's all laid out there in front for you to see.\n\nPay, sit down and eat.\n\nI like roasted chicken - here, it's not too bad.  A little better flavor than your hot roasted chicken that you'd find at your supermarket.\n\nThe sides are pretty good, too.  Not great, it should hit the spot.\n\nI'll never forget how one pecular employee at one particular location welcomed me as I walked into the door - he hollered \""Welcome to BM!\""  I won't tell you what type of grin I had while eating my lunch."	2
39	You wont get atmosphere, you wont get 5-star service, but you will get the best deal on food in town.  Its all about $5 for the best gyro and fries (and drink) in town.  Nuff said.	4
40	I rarely rate 1 star but It was terrible service. The waiter was mad all the time. I guess he was not happy to work on Christmas eve around 8:30pm. At the end, he wrote down his tip at the end of the check. I really had when a waiter write or tells you that his tip is 15% or above. Seriously, I decide what I want to pay. His service did not deserve that much money. The waiter did not let us finish our wine when he was bringing the check. I will never go back to the restaurant. Food was ok nothing that I would like to try again. \nWe ordered pizza, lasagna and steak et  frites.	0
41	We purchased photos online. We got there and immediately noticed it was very hot! The girl at the counter told us that the air-conditioner was broken and had been that way for sometime. They only had a couple of fans going. This was ridiculous. My son was there for a graduation photos so I wasn't going to cancel. If I were the one in the pictures I would have had to get a refund because my make up was melting right off my face just sitting there. Lol. They could have repaired that air-conditioner along time ago and given their customers a more pleasant experience but for some reason they hadn't. They didn't even warn me ahead of time the condition of the studio. It would have been nice to know that it would be such an uncomfortable temperature and possibly taken our business elsewhere. \n\nAlso, their props need to be updated because some are old and worn. They really weren't prepared for the pictures we were doing. Even though I left details about what we were there for. \n\nOnce we were done taking pictures we needed to view and choose the poses we wanted printed. The girl that was helping us was unprofessional and rude. She answered a personal call in the middle of helping us. She also interrupted me mid sentence to gossip with another employee as if my children and I weren't standing right next to her. And she almost ordered the wrong photos because of her lack of attention. Horrible employee. \n\nWe will definitely never go back!!!	0
42	Bought  a groupon for this place and used it yesterday. Got a shellac mani and hot stone pedi. The pedi was average not callus remover unless I wanted pay extra. The mani was avg as well. She put me under the light for a LONG time. I paid $22 for $48 value. This was  only worth $22! wouldn't go back without a groupon again.	2
43	No Complaints with this place! Support the little guy, (last mom and pop shop)  and if you ever need anything repaired this is the place Vegas!	4
44	Place looks nice, The food is pretty average though, tasted like nothing...	1
45	My parents bought a timeshare here while it was being built.  It is not walking distance from the active part of the strip.  The lobby and the rooms are nice enough, but I suspect they were cheap about certain things.  \n\nWe stayed in a two bedroom two bathroom suite.  My first shower turned into a bath because of plumbing problems, but they came up quickly to fix it.  The suite was decent sized and bedrooms were far apart - which I think is VERY important.\n\nThere isn't any decent food on site.  Luckily there was a Chipotle within walking distance.\n\nThe sales people are like vultures, I was only safe because I was a seemingly single woman who looks young.  Even on the strip they harass people, I finally asked why no one was bugging me and someone said it was because I didn't have a man with me.  I was happy not to be trapped, but how sexist!\n\nMy last night I was in the bar and a sleazy guy was making his rounds.  When I showed my disinterest he mocked me for not wearing makeup and having my hair tied back.  Then the drunken jerk started yelling at the band, telling them they suck and generally being nasty.  I find out later, he is one of the SALES people.\n\nI'd stay there again, because it's free for me - but they need to get their act together.	0
46	"Location's a pain to get to from campus but...the chicken.  \nStreet Noodle #1 is fried chicken cutlet perfection on top of flavorful, (spicy) noodles. Even if you get \""a little\"" bit of spicy, which I stupidly let the waiter talk me into getting, it will be HOT.  This is apparently not the case for Street Noodle #2, which is fried shrimp, on top of egg noodles which are considerably drier, and less spicy.  \n\nEven with the unbearable burn in my mouth, I was able to enjoy the fried chicken.  The noodles, I couldn't finish :( \n\nRestaurant is dim and spacey, with a 50cent BYOB per head charge."	3
47	Whole Foods has been the best grocery store experience in the south that I have had yet. I am a former Wegmans employee and started working for the company at 16, so I never realized what grocery stores were like outside of that and when I move to Charlotte, I was unpleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed everything about the store. My first trip there I probably spent over an hour and half walking around and seeing everything they had to offer. Prices are fairly reasonable for what you are getting and not that big of a jump in the total bill compared to a Food Lion, BI-LO, etc. Loved the wine/beer selection and the gourmet cheese ( ask the employees to taste something if you aren't confident you will like what you are thinking about purchasing). The employees were so incredibly friendly, that I spent 15 mins at the deli just chatting with the gentleman behind the counter. Lots of freshness, great customer service and options in product. I am glad Whole Foods has touched down in Charlotte.	4
48	Ive been hear twice now. Once on 4/20 2013 and 1/10/14 both good times. Its Downtown so what do you expect, its not the strip so nice jeans and shirt works. Now on 4/20 day this place was so packed, there was a line to get to the roof top and the place was just to packed. All of Vegas was packed so we got used to it. Dancing was a minimum just to packed. Now on 1/10/14 the place was busy but at least we were able to dance and enjoy the night on top of the roof with a beer in my hand. Drinks a little pricey with a beer and cosmo for 17 bucks. Bartenders drinks, my GF liked, so they knew how to make drinks. Both times we were there we had no issues, good atmosphere so we will be back.	3
49	"So I lived in Brazil for a couple years, and up until coming here, had never been to a sub-par Brazilian restaurant.  The only other place I had been in this area was Fogo de Chao - which was pricey, but incredible.  \n\nI imagine going to this place for lunch, would be okay.  It looked like you could get out of there for around $15 for lunch.  But for two dinners, two cans of guarana (Brazilian soda) and tip, it was well over $100.  Let me say that the quality of food & service would have been more reasonable in the $40 range.\n\nThe cheese bread (pao de quejo) was amazing - but it's impossible to screw that up.  The salad bar was worse than Sizzler.  I couldn't believe that rice & beans weren't available in the salad bar area, and all of the \""prepared\"" salads looked like they were scooped out of a pre-packaged bin.\n\nThe grilled pineapple was good, and the picanha (sirloin) was decent - but overall the meat selection was poor, and many of the pieces were dry and overcooked.  I guess when you spend $100 for a night out with the wife, you expect great service & to leave satisfied.  It just didn't happen here."	1
50	The staff is nice .... Tables never seem to be clean and treys the beef brisket was great except for the bread	2
51	In Pittsburg for one day. We asked 3 different locals where to find some good clean organic food. All 3 times we got the same response...Marty's Market. The atmosphere is very wholefoodie but much more dine  in. The food was fantastic and the service was equally good.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in Pittsburg and wanting to eat some clean organic food I highly, highly recommend going to Marty's.	4
52	Went in on a spur of the moment before my flight to San Francisco because it had a nice look to it. Hadn't eaten since the day before and was famished and didn't know when my next meal would come. The prices seemed kind of high, but it's an airport joint, so I figured I'd give it a shot, so I ordered a green chili burger. Took awhile to come out and when I took the first bite, the burger was warm, not hot, with a lot of pink inside. I should have sent it back but I was in a hurry and just ate it. For the price it was nothing exceptional and I left thinking I should have just ate at the Burger King and saved money (and I'm no fan of BK). \n\nMan, I should have ate at Burger King because at 3:30 a.m. I woke with my guts twisting. I haven't been that ill from food poisoning in many a year. Lasted all the next day and put a huge damper on my trip.	0
53	I do not know what it is with all of the restaurants on Mall Ring Circle in Henderson, but they all suck!   This is the third time I've been in this BW3, and it keeps getting worse.  My server today (at the bar) was nice enough, but it took 30 minutes to get one order of 8 traditional wings.  And then, they're going to charge me an extra 60 cents for some ranch to dip them in?!  They NEVER have enough staff.  The person I had today was friendly enough, but most of them in there, look like they work in the worst place on earth.  And God forbid you ask for a game on a certain TV (even when it's slow) and they act like it's a chore.  It's a shame, because the location on Warm Springs and Durango is great.  This location could definitely use a refresher course in customer service from them.  I am done with this location.  And I am done with ALL of the restaurants on Mall Ring Circle.	1
54	The chicken tacos are great I hate them two days in a row since I am not out here much.	3
55	Their food is fine. Their prices are too high for what you get. I won't go out of my way to eat there but if I'll be in the neighborhood and  have the craving for this kind of food, I'll eat there again.	2
56	We had a wonderful waitress Astrid! But the host had a face like she had just smelled something nasty the whole time she was very unwelcoming and rude to other customers. But again our waitress was wonderful	3
57	As a former Alltel employee, I understand how things work. Stores don't control pricing of plans or phones. So its about customer service. We came in to buy ourselves some new phones. Every staff member we interacted with was kind and professional. They did try to upsell some accessories, which I guess I don't blame them. Overall it was fairly a pleasant experience.	3
58	We like the Mellow Mushroom. Never had bad service there and the pizza is great. Good atmosphere and location.	3
59	- We requested a crib and it took 4 requests over 2 days to get one delivered to our room. \n- The path from the entry to the hotel elevators is full of smokers. Since this hotel does support non-smoking floors, it would be nice if this main entry area was clear of smoke. I didn't enjoy walking my baby through a cloud of smoke every day.\n- The pillows were really crummy and we had only one thin blanket on the bed.\n\nIn all, it was an inexpensive hotel that I wouldn't recommend for travelers with families.	1
60	It's been a long time since I've been here.  I will have to edit this once I figure out what I ordered, I can't remember what it is at this time. But I didnt like it!!!!! I should have ordered what my husband got was the pastrami, it was huge!  looked just like the picture!	1
61	What a disappointment this experience was.  I was the MOH for my brother and his fianc\u00e9 & this was a destination wedding.  I can only speak on my experience, so I don't have any comments about service up until the day of the wedding because I wasn't the one who booked Makeup In the 702.\n\nWe were informed that makeup and hair would start at 6am.  Each girl would take a hour, so we set-up everyone's times accordingly.  The order was mother of the bride, mother of the groom, grandmother of the groom, bridesmaid, bridesmaid, MOH and then the bride.  The wedding photographers were coming at 11am to start taking pictures & this was also around the time the bride was supposed to get her makeup and hair done.  \n\nThey started on us right away because they told us they had another appointment to get to by 9am.  Really?  So what was promised of at least 6 hours of hair & makeup was rushed and crammed to 2.5 hours.  As you can imagine, the quality and care that diminished was really apparent in the end result.  \n\nMy hair was started first & I just wanted loose curls/waves.  I brought in pictures.  My hair is long and thick & I usually do loose curls, so I was fairly confident that this would turn out okay.  The only styling product she used was a crap load of hairspray, which left my hair nappy, tangled and dry looking.  She told me she would run her fingers through my curls after my makeup was done.  After she was done & everyone rushed to their next appointment, I was left with chunks of my hair that was missed.  On to the makeup...\n\nI wear full makeup the same way everyday, so I brought in pictures of myself with makeup because I just wanted to look like how I always do.  I also fill-in my eyebrows, and for those of you who do your eyebrows everyday know how particular this can get.  Again, providing pictures of my own eyebrows and also close-up of eyebrows, I figured I'd be okay.  Wrong!  Because the girl was so rushed, she failed to notice my eyebrows were darker than even my hair & one eyebrow was smudged off in the process of doing my eyeshadow.  I don't know all the makeup jargon, but I told her I wear a smoky eye everyday & provided pictures.  Not only did it not look like the pictures, but she also decided to take it upon herself to use lighter colors.  After realizing my makeup would look nothing like the pictures I provided OF MYSELF WITH MAKEUP, I just wanted to end it & go fix my makeup myself.\n\nThe bride & I have small tattoos that we wanted covered & the person the bride booked with said this would be no problem.  This was not communicated between the staff because she said she had no idea of this & could not accommodate this because, again, she had to be somewhere at 9am.  For me, I don't care..I'm just the MOH (not the bride), so if she's so rushed for time, she should at least do the bride.  This is her day...if a service was guaranteed to her, then just get it done.  With attitude, she attempted to slap on some concealer & then wiped it off saying nothing could be done.  This was not a mistake done by the clients so proper service and professionalism, you'd think they would at least do the bride.  \n\nThere were two makeup people and two hair people.  One makeup girl did a great job.  She did two makeup jobs in the time it took the other girl to do 4 people.  The other girl took her time & their makeup was great.  Unfortunately, the person's makeup that should be flawless is the bride & she was left in tears.  Not only did most of us have to fix our makeup because the airbrushing was rushed, splotchy, and spots were missed...the bride's makeup should at least be done correctly.  If one girl was taking more time, then she should have done the bride's makeup. In hindsight, a lot of things could have been different & it's unfortunate it had to happen on such an important day.\n\nThey were in such a rush to get done and get out to their next appointment they really didn't give a crap about providing good service.  On your wedding day, that is an awful feeling.  So everyone was done by 8:30am & the wedding wasn't until 4pm.  We were scheduled to be done at 12:45pm, so we had to fix all our makeup and hair & sit around hoping our makeup would hold until the wedding. The photographers arrived at 11am expecting to catch shots of the bride getting her hair & makeup & these are photo opportunities the bride will never have.\n\nIf you're desperate to book hair & makeup and this is the only place available, you are better off doing your own makeup.  If this isn't possible, make sure you are clear about the service you're expecting and the time they will be spending.  And if they don't spend the time they promised, be sure to get it in writing to be refunded or else this company is a absolute waste of money.  You can't afford to take risks on such an important day, so I would recommend going through any other vendor for this.	0
62	"I don't think that I can add much to the already posted reviews, but here goes.\n\nGC is definitely the Walmart of music stores.  It's OK in a pinch, but you wouldn't want it as your mainstay music store.  Support the small shops whenever you can.\n\nThe one good thing about GC is the reason you don't really want to shop there, their return policy.  they'll take anything back.  Keep that in mind when you are buying something \""new\"" there.  Also, there are tons of people who don't know what they are doing going in there everyday and kicking the crap out of their gear.  If you buy something high on the wall or out of a glass case, you are probably relatively safe.\n\nProtip:  You can shop online and have stuff shipped to store and pick it up there, you can save a lot of money on shipping.\n\nProtip 2:  GC, GC.com, and Musician's Friend are all THE SAME thing."	1
63	I give this place a-ok	2
64	Busy atmosphere and can be a bit of a wait. Food is decent enough and the price O.K.. \nI did find the most memorable thing about Big in Japan, was the service.	2
65	"Seeing as I've been reviewing my recent Vegas adventures, I should probably get this one out of the draft burner.  I have a habit of letting drafts collect dust on Yelp.  So allow me to finish my four month old thoughts:\n\nZumanity is said to be \""adults only,\"" but it's no Absinthe.  It caters to adults with a few raunchy jokes here and there.  And it caters to Vegas with a few topless acts.  But for the most part, it's very tame and even a bit campy.  I didn't find the show pushing the envelop on anything and it didn't appear at all sensual to me.\n\nI brought the boyfriend.  he enjoyed himself but didn't see why I fuss over Cirque du Soleil so much.  On reflection, I should have taken him to see something a bit more awe-inspiring (like \""O\"").  \n\nA lot of the comedy is just heckling the nearby crowd.  And a lot of the acts highlighted in the program were absent during our particular show.  No midgets, no fat twins.  Perhaps that would have added some flavor to an otherwise lackluster evening.  Maybe I was suspecting something too outside the norm and my expectations were bridging on pornographic?  To me, this was a typical Cirque show with some dirty jokes and sexier outfits thrown into the mix.\n\n50% off tickets for military.  So a good deal to fill a few hours of your time."	2
66	Food and Wine were excellent as always will return again very soon. The veal was fantastic.	4
67	Todd at AP is great, brought a couple Chinese phones back to life for me. I never buy through the carrier, and with more and more device support overseas, it's nice to have walk-in, Apple Store-level service available for Androids at AP.	4
68	The sheer power and aura around this place for ten minutes helped finalize my decision to go to UW-Madison. I wanted to be there. The setting is that good.\nEnough said.	4
69	I am standing outside of Dotty ' s on Tropicana and Jones located in the CVS. The employee who is working there right now just mowed down a pedestrian with his car. He took off went around the building and the snuck into Dotty 's with no regard to the pedestrian on the ground. There are 3 eye witnesses. While waited for ambulance and police to arrive he comes out and says he didn't hit anyone, then when we show him the damage to his car he claimed the pedestrian jumped onto his car. I find this totally unacceptable. We went in and asked for corporate ' s number and he refused to give it to us. Guess I will continue to tell all my Facebook friends take his picture and post a danger to others notice all while he collect his paycheck from Dotty's. Nice company no one I know will ever go to your locations again.	0
70	I really enjoyed my choice of black coffee here while my friends didn't. I just think they chose the wrong one. I got the one that was mixed with dark and light roast beans. I can't remember the name but it was delicious! No disgusting coffee aftertaste. All in all, I'd be back here and get the same coffee the next time I'm in town!	4
71	Creamy consistency, ability to mix two adjacent flavors, ok-fresh toppings (usual fruit - berries- and cookie, candy, nut toppings). Fifty cents an ounce, ouch...\n\nA few sugar free choices that didn't taste too much like saccharin. Also, dairy free sorbet option (when I went it was raspberry pomegranate). Overall a moderately decent option if you're really craving fro yo after a whirlwind shopping extravaganza at forever 21.	2
72	So close to a five star rating, but I wasn't jumping up and down in my pants - just very happy and looking forward to going back. Enough? Definitely. \n\nRoger and I shared a white mushroom pizza on sprouted grain dough recommended by a friend and fan in California. Delicious. Artfully layered and flavored and almost melting on my tongue. I'm still tasting it today. \n\nWhile sitting, two friends happened to stop by for a pizza and ordered the single packaged glasses of wine. Sweet! Wish I had thought of that idea. Next time.\n\nAn artisan eatery that is worth a visit or two or three. So, happy to find some other crafty places in Charlotte. Maybe I'm starting to like it here.	3
73	Went here for the first time with my mom yesterday for a Sunday brunch. We went there around 12:30 and it wasn't too crowded--we got seated immediately.\n\nI had a hankering for corned beef and hash, so that's what I ordered. Unfortunately it wasn't quite what I was expecting...at other brunch places I've been to, the corned beef and hash browns are cooked and served together, but here the corned beef was served with scrambled eggs on top, and the hash browns were on the side. I was a bit disappointed by that.\n\nOther than the disappointing food, everything else was great. Service was prompt, our food came out quickly, and our server stopped by our table multiple times to inquire about our meal.	2
74	Nice place but poor customer service and staff! Always state they are fully booked and not enough cleaning staff. Rooms are not updated and not thoroughly clean.  Rooms not ready to well past check-in time (7pm)..horrible for a family starting vacation.  They have had made major cutbacks since their own new ownership.  Condos is not not even stocked with enough toilet paper or extra paper products.  Greens on golf course were okay definitely not well-maintained compared to the other resorts in the area.  Overall this was an okay resort definitely would be a great place to stay with the family if ownership was different and the place was maintained the way it should be.	1
75	"I was SO looking forward to my stay at the Venetian especially since Venice was one of my favorite oversea cities and this is the closest I'll ever be to it in a while. My friend got us upgraded to the Bella Suite, which was really nice. I loved how all the cooridors and hallways were decorated as a contempory spin on the timelessness of Europe. (sighs) \n\nEverything was clean and in place, but hotel service desk were a little unprofessional. Our last day there, we asked for a late check-out and that was ok. But when us girls were getting ready, the circuits in the bathroom and plug outside the bathroom short-circuited. When my friend called the front desk to have them come fix it, front desk asked us if we wanted it fixed or if we were calling to just let them know. What does that even mean?! It would have to be fixed anyways and good customer service skills would have prompted you to say \""we will have someone come up right now to fix it.\"" AHHH! And we had to wait about 30 min. before anyone showed up. \n\nI'm sure if this hadn't happened, I would be more satisfied. Oh Venetian, I really wanted to give you 4 stars, but it's still a nice hotel. The only other thing is that the bathroom area in the Bella suite has no lock."	2
76	We stayed in the older part of the hotel and the experience was gross.  Peeling wallpaper in the room meets urine stains from a previous guest on the toilet which took 5 hours for the staff to address properly (you know...like cleaning it).  Disgusting.  It may be inexpensive, but it was also unsanitary.	0
77	Great place to have a few cocktails before heading out. The solero is awesome! The pricing is a little high, but hey you pay for what you get. Highly recommend this place to pregame before heading to you're destination	3
78	The front office supervisor is incredibly rude. Sad that my mom went to this office for years and this is how I am treated. Not only did my mom never get an accurate diagnosis when the entire world knew she had dementia, but now I am dealing with someone raising my own blood pressure. Ridiculous.	0
79	Billy's ultimate steam pot and oysters are great. It sits right by the water too.	3
80	This is for the lounge only-  Do not ever pay cover to get in here!!!  Cover should not even exist at this place, but if you can't find the guy in the casino making it rain passes, you deserve to pay.  There is no dress code to speak of- if that's your thing.  Went up, walked outside for a bit-nice view, too cold, went back inside, ordered a witch doctor, listened to music, watched bartender make witch doctors, finished drink, left, no more line to get in.  Uh yeah.	1
81	Not long after posting my review, I was contacted by their Director of Marketing & Community Relations apologizing for my less than excellent experience. She was incredibly sweet and accommodating. My gripes about my experience there still stand, but I commend them for taking my criticisms and addressing them with me in an appropriate and appreciative manner. Hopefully, they'll still take my to-go cup gripe to heart.	1
82	I was really excited about staying in the new city center.  I've been to Vegas several times and normally opt to stay off the strip due to fact that most of the reasonably priced hotels on the strip are extremely old so when I found a under $200 rate at a new modern hotel I was geeked!!!\n \nUnfortunately that ended fairly soon. \n\nROOM: Great looking, very modern & spacious, yet there is no real direction as to how everything works. Took me 15-20 minutes to get things working properly and even then I had several lights that I could not get to turn on. also the only outlets are at the front of the room by the tv. No night stand outlets so if you are like me and like having you phone close to you at all times, charge it during the day else be forced to get up out of bed in the middle of the night to answer it.\n\nFRONT DESK: Very friendly yet sometimes inefficient.  Had to call several times about getting my lights fixed. Internet wouldn't work properly and they kept transferring me to the wrong people to fix it. Called for an extension cord so that I could work comfortably in my bed b/c the outlet is soooooo far away and she talked to me as if it was the silliest thing they've ever heard.  Let how odd is it that I would want an outlet near me so I could work from my bed or answer my phone!\n\nCONCIERGE: They just seemed confused. The last time I visited Vegas I used the monorail to get around the strip. Being that the city center is so new and I asked about trains, buses, monorails to get back and forth.  Th e1st concierge told me about the free shuttle to get to Bellagio. The 2nd told me about the RTC bus. The 3rd told me to walk to MGM grand and get the monorail. None of them actually got me to where I was trying to go.  I just ended up taking a taxi because they confused me even more.\n\nELEMENTS: This is their 24 hour one stop shop although looking from the outside you would never know this.  When walking by it looks like a clothing shop advertising the Elvis show but they have everything. I loved it until I went to pay and couldn't find a register that was open.  When I finally saw an employee standing by a register I sat my items on the counter and she pointed at a closed sign that was closer to another register. Didn't even speak or try to get me some help.  I was flabbergasted! \n\nPROS: Great vibe. Not at all casino-y lol Has a upscale feel. Nice location. Great food although lacks a cost variety. Cheapest cup of coffee in this place was $8\n \nCONS: Room has hair everywhere. I have no clue where it came from because my housekeeper was bald. My towels were noticeably dirty and one reeked of smoked.\n\nI like the feel of the City Center but I won't stay here again.  May try Planet Hollywood or the Cosmopolitan next time.	1
83	The best thing about this hotel is the location, its right between downtown and the strip.\n\nI got put in one of the older rooms, not yet renovated. It's dark and stuffy. There is no coffee maker in the room and the bathrooms are super small. During my stay the blow dryer blew and there were sparks everywhere.\n\nThe maids dont vacuum unless you ask them to, which I find a bit gross. If you try and call house keeping you'll be on hold for at least 5 minutes. The staff is a hit or miss, some friendly others not so much. \n\nThere's a handful of restaurants through out the hotel, pricier than usual. Its pretty cool to go up to the top of the tower for the view, especially at night. The hotel has some perks even a pool but I would stay somewhere else next tim	1
84	"this place opened and fell right on its face. I haven't had the desire to go back after the lack of taste and their inability to plan seems to be part of their business model. I had the turkey leg, the last one, and it was 6pm. I stood in line for what seemed to be an hour, I'm not sure why they don't have a large menu posted that everyone can read. ok on to my meal, they did get it right, the bad part was the my sides where mac'n cheese and beans, mac seemes like it'd been sitting all arternoon, mushy and slimy. the beans had a very boring flavor like you expect from something from a can. the turkey leg itself was a lot of fat with about 4 oz of meatit had decent flavor, I was just pissed about the size. So unfortunatly south Phoeinx is again without a good take home BBQ place, because while jakes may still be open i'm seeing a \""out of business\"" sign comming unless changes are made."	1
85	Friendly service and a good place for a burger, thumbs up!	3
86	"I am so surprised at the good reviews for this dental practice! My husband and I had the worst experiences. I have never written a bad review, but would like to stop someone from this mistake.\n\nWe both went in for yearly basic cleanings. My husband's appointment was a day before mine. At 6 at night they tried to talk him into a root canal that night! He had not had any pain mind you. He called me and I said it was fishy they were trying to talk him into it that night. He said no to that but they did talk him into a deep cleaning. He did half that night and was supposed to do the other half the next day when I went in as well.\nFor my appointment, they took tons of X-rays then sat me in the chair. The doc came in and went over all the procedures they thought I should have. My 2 remaining wisdom teeth pulled, five cavity fills and a deep cleaning. I consider my teeth in very good shape and have had no pain whatsoever. As they were going over their recommendations I noticed on the computer screen everything had \""patient accepts\"" next to it. I said I did not want anything except the basic cleaning that was covered 100% by my full dental insurance. They then went on to lie to me and say that since I \""needed\"" deep cleaning that my insurance would not pay for a basic cleaning. I could not believe it. I walked out with nothing and called my insurance company. They said they've never heard of that and that I am fully covered for one basic cleaning a year and they'd never deny that. I was shocked. \nI could go on and on but the short of it is that we ended up with a $400 bill for my husbands deep cleaning AFTER insurance paid another $400 hundred dollars!!\nThey are major scam artists! They take your electronic signature and transpose it onto receipts! Never sign anything electronically while lying in the chair getting the procedure done as they had my husband do!\nWe went to AT Stills since then and the professors told my husband they had even botched his deep cleaning! \nPlease re-think choosing Tempe Modern Dentistry!"	0
87	An easy little stroll from Excalibur, MGM, New York New York and a few other hotels on the strip.  They have literally EVERYTHING.  \n\nGreat place to do some room stocking when a simple soda or bottle of water is 3 bucks and up in the casino.  I wandered down to grab some beverages and snacks for the stay and was back to my room in no time.  \n\nNice to know there's somewhere you can grab a few things you may have forgotten or didn't think you needed.	3
88	The Food and service was excellent. I left feeling highly satisfied and will absolutely be coming here again to fulfill sushi cravings. I especially recommend the calamari.	4
89	I was really impressed with their Boca burger.  It's not every fast food hamburger joint that has a veggieburger.  I was really glad it was well done because I ordered everything on the burger.  It seemed like this place was always open; people were constantly lined up to try the Fatburger.	2
90	I received some dining credits from Hilton & noted that VooDoo was on the list.  Since we hadn't been to the Rio in a while we decided to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised that this restaurant is on the 50th floor of the hotel & had an amazing panoramic view over the strip & beyond.  I was traveling with friends & we had no reservation, but on a Monday night the restaurant was quiet - we were seated immediately.  Service was provided by Tony who was excellent - attentive, knowledgable, and helpful in offering suggestions.  We picked steak tartare and lobster bisque for appetizers - the tartare rivaled any I have had in France and the bisque was amazing.  For an entree I had the lamb chops and my friends had the scallops - while awaiting dinner Tony offered us to take wine & go out on the deck to see the cityscape; the view was great!  A member of the waitstaff came to get us when dinner was ready.  Dessert was chocolate cake for me - amazingly good as well!  Service was exceptional; food was excellent; there is a night club upstairs & it started to flow into our dinner experience, so a minor ding for that, but overall would recommend and will likely come back.	3
91	I got a Groupon for HottCakez. I called at 10:11AM on Monday and the Gal on the phone told me to come by at 12:30PM, because that's when they would be open and I could come in and pick out a dozen cupcakes. So, my sister, my 5 year old niece, 7 week old niece, and I went shopping near by to kill two hours. For some reason NOTHING in Las Vegas is close by, the freeway and highway are all so round about, it takes you almost 30 minutes to get anywhere. Anyway, we came back at 12:30 on the dot and the place still was not open. I went up to the door to check and one of those generic clock signs said, be back at and the clock arms pointed to 1PM. Disappointed, I got back in the car, told my sister the situation, and waited. My sister had to make a phone call, so she agreed to wait. 1:00PM came and went, at 1:10PM I called the number again this time with no answer and I left a message, with no returned phone call. A nice Gal, who I assume owns the pizza place, said that the HottCakez owner was there, because her bar is near the back, and she saw them back there. The place never opened...\n\nNeedless to say, we didn't get any cupcakes as promised and we will NEVER be going back. Customer service is horrible. If you can't deliver, don't tell me to come back and then NOT answer your phone. I don't mind coming back another day, just let me know. Just because I'm a Groupon buyer, doesn't make me less of a customer. I spent money already, and haven't even tried your product, and now because of you, I never will. We all get busy or things come up, it's how we deal with it that counts.	0
92	*Get a Wynn players club card the savings helped.\n\nFew things here are bad and the offering are just amazing. From French to Seafood they really have a decent selection. And desert is a must. \n\nThe wait wasn't too bad, pricing was high but it really didn't matter at the time. \n\nI didn't really enjoy the ice cold crab legs but i did like how they were perfectly sliced down the middle, only if they were deboned :-).\n\nI was confused by the untouched pizza, in a place which tried coming off as a higher end solution to a buffet. Not seeing single slice removed in my rounds. I didn't understand why it was served. \n\nRice dishs were plentiful , as were multiple soups with a lot of selection based on cooking style.\n\nThe best moment had to be the before desert coffee. It was nice being offered it.\n\nFor a buffet it was excellent. As for the price it didn't really match. \n\nAs for the service i wasn't wowed more then being offered free coffee.	3
93	German food: What is German food? Is it good? These were two of my questions, prior to coming here. I absolutely love it! I love  the sauerkraut, the brauts, the schnitzel, and the pretzels! The food here is amazing and the service is terrific. Now I'm a German food lover.  Oktoberfest is almost here! We'll be reserving our table this coming week. Can't wait!!	4
94	The sushi bar, their recent addition in their menus, seems to bring more people in this place, which is good for their business. But the downside is that everything got SUPER SLOW. I went there at around noon and had to wait FOREVER for my foods, it was more than 30 min. I don't think it's acceptable by any standard! They seriously need to learn how to streamline their services, or if not, hire more cooks, more servers. And, why the hell do they speak Chinese to non-Chinese people? Please do speak English.\n\nOn top of that, the worst part is that THEY CHARGED SOMEONE ELSE'S TABLE TO MY CARD AND GAVE MY CARD TO THAT PERSON AND GOT ME THAT PERSON'S CARD BACK AFTER PAYMENT. Luckily I checked my bank account the next morning and found out right away there were TWO transactions from Little Asia and the one I didn't recognize. It turned out they accidentally swiped my card for that other table and gave my card to that person who used it later that day without knowing it's not his or hers. They made a horribly stupid mistake of mixing the two customers' cards up. How lame!	0
95	There was a lot to like about The Play Factory.  The best part?  The superb customer service.  Their employees were so helpful and friendly.  They made me and my child feel right at home, despite us using a Groupon for a huge discount! \n\nThe main drawbacks?  It just got busy so quickly, which made the smallish space get a bit claustrophobic to me.  Going right at opening time and leaving by 10:30am is your best bet!  My 2 year old had a great time climbing, but I know that my 7-year-old would be bored quickly with only a couple climbers to choose from.\n\nIt is a handy escape from the heat, and worth checking out - but come EARLY!	2
96	This place was ok I had tool my kids here for dinner n honestly there food was ok it wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst I've ever had. There prices weren't that bad but the selection n quality of the food was not up to par. I might visit this place if were in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.	2
97	I had fun when i went to this club last year!  Didn't have to wait in line at all.... fun times!	2
98	We went to try there Fish fry for $10.99 available Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday.\nI have to say, you get a lot of food for the money.  But the fried calamari was the best.  The plate was full of calamari & frys.  Could not finish it all.  One of has the fish and the other the shrimp.  Also comes with green beens, onions rings, hush puppies & coleslaw.  Signing up for there club also gets you $$ off coupons almost weekly.	3
99	This is one of my local supermarkets. I see myself coming here once a week they always have specials, plus the staff is very friendly. They have a variety of stations \nWe can start off with the \n\nBread/cakes\n They have a wide and cheap assortment of breads and cake that you can choose from. Its freshly baked everyday. I would highly recommend as that you give the stuffed bolio a try. It has jalapenos and cream cheese baked on the inside.The cakes are great as well.\n\nMeat Dept\nEvery week they run great specials on different meat or seafood. It is very clean and organized. (Sometime the lines are really long but worth it cuz there are some cute guys in the back)\n\nProduce\nI would be careful when looking at the produce from my perspective they have cheap cheap produce, but sometime they have a lot that is on the verge of going bad. \n\nHot food \nThis is the best they have carnitas, chicharron en salsa verde, beans, rice, fried onions, fried jalapenos, and boy oh boy oh boy they are effin delicious. They have family packs where you can get 2lbs. of  carnitas (pork meat) beans, rice and tortillas for around $18.00 bucks.\n\nEnjoy.\nI might have missed something, I will edit as I go along.	4
100	Whatever. It's Wal-mart. HOWEVER am I the only one who gets ELECTROCUTED every time I am in this store??? There is some weird problem I have (I'm so not kidding) with THIS store. EVERYTHING I touch shocks me. At first I thought maybe there was a short in their freezers or something, but it happens just walking through the store. (the cart zaps me every once in a while) What is up with that?? Lol	1
101	I think this may be the best place on the strip for blackjack. My nephew mentioned this place as being the best and I  agree.   It has the most $5 Blackjack tables of any place I've found on the strip.  They are far and few between.  My three sisters went in together playing one Wheel of Fortune slot machine and managed to pull out $500 off of  one machine the first day we were there.   I probably sunk at least half of that though..so I wasn't so lucky.  Breakfast was good  at their Victorian Cafe. If you go early enough (before 8 am) they have some sort of steak and eggs special for $6.00 or $7.00.  Coffee is not that good though.	3
102	"I went to MMS during my last vacation because I wanted to check out the Incoco Nail Bar (there's only three in LV, and none back home).  Since the other two branches aren't at places I'd ever go to (Hawaiian Marketplace and Harrah's), MMS was the best bet.  Also, this mall includes a Bath & Body Works (which both my friend and I wanted to shop at), so we knew we could manage to \""kill two birds with one stone.\""\n\nAs soon as my friend and I walked into MMS (from the North Entrance), we had to deal with politely refusing an \""offer\"" to attend a timeshare presentation.  We were short on time but since I really hate to cut people off when they're talking, we stood there for a good 10 minutes or so listening to the sales pitch... *cringes*  \n\nAfter that, we grabbed a mall map brochure and proceeded toward somewhere to eat for lunch.  TBH, there weren't many choices to pick from, in terms of what I was willing to eat / spend.  We ended up going to Cheeseburger Las Vegas (I've been to other branches).  While we sat in there, I took a look at my mall map to take note of what stores I wanted to check out.  FFS, what is with the color coding system (especially since it's based on store location instead of store category)???\n\nFollowing our lunch, I stopped by Victoria's Secret to buy a few things for the remainder of my trip.  Then I went to the Incoco kiosk while my friend went to the Massage Professionals for Health kiosk.  Not much to say here other than I probably shouldn't deal with any kiosk vendors when I'm half-asleep...  Oh well, lesson learned =P\n\nAs it turns out, BBW was the highlight of shopping at MMS.  We browsed at several other stores, including French Connection, H&M, Bread & Butter, United Colors of Benetton, and The Walking Company.  None of these stores impressed me much.\n\nAt the end of the day, I'd have to say that if Incoco had more kiosk locations around Las Vegas - specifically, in The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace - I'd go there and completely avoid MMS altogether."	2
103	Worst experience ever. DO NOT EAT HERE.The only reason I'm giving one star is because the potstickers were amazing. But that is the only good thing about this restaurant. The service we horrible. The waiters throw things on the table and don't  check back and the check was never brought. The cashier was highly disrespectful and rude. Do not eat here. There are other Vietnamese restaurants in town. Find a more friendly location.	0
104	I've had pets my whole life and my observation has been that when the 's front desk staff is nice and proffesional , the doctors are not and when the doctors are great, the front desk leaves much to be desired.  This was not the case at Alta Vista.  First off, there hours are great.  Secondly. the front desk people (Sam), the techs and the doctor (Dr. Sean Penn), very friendly and courteous.  And finally, the price was reasonable. That, along with the place being clean and not smelling like wet dog when you walk in made having to take my dog in on a Sunday afternoon as pleasant as could be.  So far so good.	3
105	Me and my wife went to the meatball spot the classic ball is bland and dry. The stuffed ball I had was empty the pesto was bland. The chef needs to be given salt and pepper. Neather me or my wife will be back.	0
106	Pretty decent location for a nice target store.\nWhen I lived in the area I would frequent this target location and was happy with the service and product selection.\nLocated in the surprise town center shopping district alongside many great shops.	3
107	An excellent castle.  We wandered around the castle for hours and had an amazing time.  We were surprised when they shot a cannon at 1PM, and apparently they do that every day.  We went back the next day to discover that there was an admission fee.  I don't know how we missed that the day before.  Oops.\n\nIf you've never seen a real castle, this is the place to lose your castle virginity.	3
108	Dr. Bonsett-Veal was great!  I think he is very personal and related to me quickly.  He was my first eye-doctor visit ever and I felt great.  He also explained my options, like whether to get glasses or not for my slight vision correction, and an extra 'eye-mapping' test.  Which I got and he emailed to me so I have on my records!  \n\nI went sunglass shopping there because he recommended it, they were very helpful to help us look around, however the prices were higher than other places, and the cheap glasses didn't fit as well as we would've liked, besides that I thought it was perfect.	3
109	I'd put a 4.5 star rating if it was available.\n\nThe knocked off half star would be because out of 5 visits or more, one time the pecan crusted trout came out under cooked and bland. I did arrive a bit late and I believe the kitchen was trying to close. I don't feel like a 945pm arrival time for 1030pm closing is that bad. maybe they were trying to close early due to a slow turn out.\n\nEvery item I've had here is yummy. Yesterday I came here and got the $36 alaskan king crab legs. They were very yummy (not the best I've had, but a damn steal for that price!)\n\nThe ambiance is great for a date.\n\nSome wet naps would of been really nice after the crab legs, but oh well, i don't knock off points there.\n\nI love the arnold palmer. I think the lemonade is their restaurant recipe, and it really gives a great after taste with the arnold palmer.	3
110	"Sure, it's not far away from home, but once you enter The Boulders' incredible property, you feel like you've been transported to another world!  Our one-night staycation at this renowned resort exceeded my expectations.\n\nWe lucked out and stayed in one of the renovated casitas.  It had plenty of room all around; what a perfect layout!  (An extremely comfortable king bed, a desk, a sitting room, a fireplace, walk-in closet, flat screen TV, large bathroom and a patio with a gorgeous view).  In addition, they have every amenity one would expect and more.  High end spa products, robes, mini-bar, etc... plus extra special touches such as a flash light on a keychain for wandering the property at night, and a bedside book for your reading pleasure entitled \""Life is Good.\""  Our casita # was 282 in case anyone wants to put in a special request ;)  It's located near the Golden Door Spa which I'll review separately but highly recommend!\n\nDuring the 24 hours we spent at The Boulders, we sat by the main pool, had some lunch, visited the spa, Jared played a bit of golf (I hear the course is pretty spectacular), saw a coyote, worked out in the top notch fitness center and movement studio, had a glorious breakfast at the Spa Cafe, and were blown away by the friendly staff / service all around.  \n\nThe Boulders truly provides a Zen-like experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing get-away in a first class resort.  I will warn you, it's pricey in high season.  Thankfully, we did have a gift card this time... but I can't wait to return and take advantage of their summer rates (which I hear are pretty incredible).  \n\nJust like the book that sits bedside in the casita, staying at The Boulders really does remind you that \""life is good!\"""	4
111	If I could give it a zero I would have. This was the worst nail job that I have ever had. I went into get fills on my pink and whites. I decided to get a color tip that turned into this thick big blob on my nails. It was the guy that has long hair that did my nails, he said that he has been doing them for 11 years. I don't honestly believe that he even has a license. My nails were so think and clumpy that he went to go put the gel on them and I told him that I did not like anything that he has done to my nails and that they are horrible. I had to ask him to sand them down more so that they didn't look like a 1st grader did my nails....he also took my nice curve that you have in your nail that seperates the tip and made it a straight or semi straight line. I asked him what happened to my curves and he just sat there. Not to mention the (2) smoking breaks he took while doing my nails....I mean who doesn't love leaving a nail salon with there hands smelling like smoke. I would not recommend this place to anyone!!!!!! A complete waste of money!!!!	0
112	Sub par. The service, the ambiance, the menu. The best part about Zipps is the - albeit limited - selection of draft beer! If you just need a casual hang-out spot for a happy hour, this place will do just fine.	1
113	A rating of 0.5 would be more appropriate.  Our dinner at this coffee shop proved to be disappointing.  Ann ordered the fresh salmon which came with mashed potatoes, salad and mixed vegetables.  I ordered the halibut, salad, roasted potatoes and the same mixed vegetables. Both pieces of fish were overcooked and everything else was below mediocre with the exception of the veggies.  I thought we could salvage our dinner with slices of their highly acclaimed pies. Ann chose chocolate cream while I settled on coconut custard.  Each was probably the equivalent of a Mrs. Smith's frozen pie though, in all honesty, I have never had a Mrs. Smith's pie so I may be insulting Mrs. Smith.  One last note - our server was crabby.	0
114	Kung Paola's good... Trying General Tsao today	3
115	"Well... I would maybe have been inclined to give Chez Claudette a higher rating if it hadn't been for the following....\n\nordered a poutine classique to go, and then because it was pouring rain decided to eat it inside by the front door.  Even though the place wasn't busy, our french quebec waitress told us that \""next time we order it to go, we have to eat it outside\"".\n\nthe sauce also kind of tasted like thick canned poutine sauce.  \n\nit was still a delicious poutine and we ate the whole thing.\n\nOur small poutine was around $7.  the same price as any other poutine spot."	1
116	Okay, so my husband wanted to go here since he'd heard of it. Big, big mistake. If could give them 0 stars I would. \n\nFirst, DO NOT take a taxi to get there. They charge you $30 per person if you do, because they have to pay off the taxi driver. So don't expect the $10 price advertised on their website. And don't forget the 2 drink minimum per person, and drinks are $15 each. \n\nSecond, it's not nearly as nice as I expected it to be. The reputation is as a high class strip club, but in reality it's very trashy. The girls were so-so, nothing special. None of them really made use of the poles. If you want a good pole dance show, try Cirque du Soleil instead. \n\nI highly, highly recommend against going there.  Definitely not the kind of place where a woman can go with her husband comfortably.	0
117	College bar staple with great half-price food, a large menu, and excellent beer specials.	3
118	"Honestly, I was NOT impressed.  Actually extremely disappointed to say the least!  I had been wanting to stay here and had the chance to last night.  The weather got super windy so I decided it was safe for me to stay an extra night and not fly my plane back home to LA.  I was initially staying at the Mandarin Oriental and switched over to give the Four Seasons a try.  Well I am so sorry that I did.  The people at the front desk were \""OK\"".  You can tell that they were just being fake and could care less about you.  Not to mention they were not informative about the property whatsoever.  They just sent me on my way.  So that was fail a big fail.  Ok, so then I make my way up to the room.  Eh, it was alright.  It was clean and decent.  It looked like it hadn't been updated in forever.  The only great thing about the room was that the bed was super comfy (hence the 2 stars vs. 1).  After I unpacked I made my way down to the pool.  It was nice and everything but the service left little to be desired.  I sat and waited and had to flag down several different people before I could order any food.  After waiting so long for a server, I decided to order their frozen grapes hoping they would come out pretty quickly.  Well it took a good 30 or so minutes to just get grapes!  Which, honestly, were terrible.  After that, I went back up to my room to get ready for dinner because I was still starving.  So I chose to try out their Veranda restaurant (italian).  The food there was fantastic.  My only complaint about my experience is that the server was really pushy and kept trying to sell me the most expensive items on the menu, which was quite annoying.  Ok, so I will just fast forward to later that evening.  At about 9:45pm, I called room service to order dessert and coffee.  I asked the gal if the chocolate cake was warmed and she said yes since it is served with ice cream.  So I agreed to give it a try.  Well, what do you know the cake shows up cold (I find out later that she lied to me and that the cake is NEVER served warm).  Then my pot of coffee I ordered was cold and nasty.  I know exactly what they did.  They took an old pot and diluted it with hot water.  I worked in the hospitality industry for years.  You can't fool me.  For a piece of cake and coffee it was $40.  I was pissed.  So I called and complained.  They said they were brewing me fresh coffee and would bring it up right away.  But I am a HUGE coffee person and it still wasn't good.  Oh well.  I certainly was not ordering any for breakfast.  Now it is Sunday, today, and I was getting ready to check out.  Pulled out my valet ticket and noticed they charge an additional $22 overnight fee just for that!  I am pretty much fuming at this point.  I will NEVER stay here again and I will make sure to tell as many of my friends and family of my terrible experience at this establishment."	1
119	Hubby and I wanted to warm up from the 30 degree weather so pho seemed like a good idea. Service was good. Restaurant was clean and pretty busy. I didn't really enjoy the pho with beef slices. It had a weird sweet after taste. I've tasted a lot of pho in my day. And I just didn't care for it. My husband enjoyed the Summer Rolls with peanut sauce. Sorry, I can't find a reason to go back.	1
120	Good prices, great service, great food.  If you want Korean and don't want the ambiance of Mothers, or the nastiness of Korean Garden, come here.	3
121	The only good thing about this eatery is its proximity to the Benedum. The three of us were seated at a table that was jammed in between two other tables, next to the kitchen - even though the place was half empty. I could hear the conversation at the next door table better than that of people sitting opposite me. The food was a sorry, sloppy, soggy mess that would have had Chef Ramsey throw up. The service was slow, inattentive, and made you feel vaguely unwelcome. Ridiculously overpriced. For  better value, a nicer atmosphere, and quality food, I strongly recommend a couple of places nearby that beat Tambellini's hands down - McDonalds or SubWay.	0
122	The Good:  The Salsa is pretty good, they give you both a hot and a mild with your chips.  They also provide a bean dip that isn't bad either.    \n\nThe Bad:   The food is nothing special.   I got the shrimp burrito and all it in it were bean, rice and five shrimp.  For $12-$13 bucks i was expecting a little more.    My wife had the carne asada tacos and wasn't that impressed either.\n\nWe went on a Friday night and they said it would be 20min wait.  No big deal it is a Friday night I thought.  But when we were finally sitting down half the place was empty.    So i didn't really get why we had to wait.\n\nThe waiter was unorganized, he gave us a check that had items on it we didn't even order.   To top it all off, its was really hot in there.   Its Arizona in the middle of summer for god sake.  If your going to serve sub-par food at least keep the place cool.	1
123	Very flavorable  food. We went with another couple and we basically got 4 starters, 4 dinners & 3 deserts and shared it all. I feel like I got a good sample of a lot of items on the menu at once. Yes it was a lot of food but excellent.	4
124	"This is an okay neighborhood mexican food spot.  I've been here a dozen times or so, and it's just okay.  Always an upbeat vibe at this place since it's a popular neighborhood spot, but the food it the type you say \""uhh, probably won't come back here for a while.\""  Pricing is reasonable for what you get and the service is what you'd expect.  I'll go back, but it's not a place I crave."	1
125	I went to a late lunch here today.  Great food and great carhops!  A reasonable value and quick service.  Unfortunately, it all comes with a large helping of rudeness from the person taking the orders.  You never see the person who takes your order which is a major weakness in their system.   Today that anonymity was taken advantage of by someone who decided to be abrasive and condenscending  So if you are really hungry and want a side order of crappy attitude and abuse with your lunch, this is the place for you. Personally, I'm going to give it some time because no business can succeed with an employee acting like this.	1
126	The wait staff was nice, The service was good, The food was as good as it always is at CPK. If you like CPK.. You will like it here	2
127	I was on vacation and forgot my medication, so I came here on a random Tuesday to get a prescription filled. There was only one pharmacist working, so a simple prescription took about an hour (the medication is already pre-packaged). It was a bit frustrating to wait so long for something so simple.\n\nOther than that, it's an average Walgreens but there are peddlers outside, and the clientele inside can be a bit odd. It's nice that this location is open 24 hours.	2
128	"So I'm not use to do bad reviews but... We have always excellent times in rum runner the bartender Darryl is a great guy ! But the last time of we been there order 2 simple stuff and I indicate the girl to take the food orders \""no tomato in my good I have allergy to that\""  my food quesadilla and fries come 35 minutes after quesadillas full of tomato... And her just take the food and leave don't let me any time to request a change or anything! I love the place as bar but the food service sucks! \n\nThe picture of I place there are of other visit because we go all time there :/"	1
129	We were only in town for the weekend but happened to catch a food show about places in Montreal and on it they talked about the custom soft-serve ice cream flavours they produce. The next day we happened to be driving by, so stopped and got some cones. Very tasty! Friendly owners, cute set up! Would come back to try the next flavours.	2
130	This location is not a nice as the Saint Denis location, but the food is pretty much the same. Chocolate Chocolate and more Chocolate, if you go you must try the chocolate port, port and chocolate go so well together.	2
131	"Gorgeous ambiance and amazing aesthetics in the Casino area of ARIA... UN-Fortunately... the food isn't any good and the drinks are mediocre.  Great choice of tequilas and scotch which was cool. You're best off getting chips and salsa and a water, and thats about it.   This is Mexican food for the white man!!  It's not authentic, or traditional, but it is a great place to take a date b/c the decor is amazing.  Too bad the food isn't as good as the venue!  $8 for a tecate and $14 for an average margarita.  If you want great Mexican food with great drinks VISIT \""SEGUNDO\"" by the fashion show mall/RA sushi.  If you don't care about good food but want a nice atmosphere, but all means visit!"	1
132	I went for breakfast with a friend.  YUM!!  I had the most delicous breakfast burrito.  The potatoes are as yummy as they come.  We used an entertainment coupon for buy one get one but it would have been cheap even without it.  I can't wait to go back.	3
133	OMG this is seriously my favorite place to eat on mill. I love that you can get a super tasty burrito quickly and hang out and have a drink at the bar. And they are really cheap. I would highly recommend the pork. It's shredded and has a nice kick to it.	4
134	This club is pretty dinky, but maybe that was just because I had been to Tao the night before. \n\nHowever, Steve Aoki was DJing, which made the atmosphere a lot better.\nIt was also HILARIOUS when they had the Michael Jackson impersonator come out. So awesome.\nI also noticed a couple UFC fighters in the building.\n\nIt is very similar to a strip club in terms of near-naked, toned girls getting paid to shake their asses for an audience. But the main point was to create a sexy atmosphere, I believe, which they succeeded in doing. \n\nThere was no line to get in here, unlike Tao, and it wasn't too bad of a price either. $30 for my guy and $20 for myself.\n\nThe experience was good, but not great.	2
135	From the apps to the desserts, I have not had a bad meal. Yes, you can find one in most major areas, but its good food. Why not hit the places you know are dishing out consistent meals?	3
136	I have a lot better things to do than go into a bar that's big claim to fame is the fact that it has a big tree with a string of christmas lights on it.\n\nI've been in here once, and once was enough.  If you are actually sitting in one of the few places to sit, all that means is that you are such a huge lush that you got there at 6 o'clock.  So, you can wipe that smirky look off your face, drunko.	1
137	Way too yummy! Get the red velvet!	4
138	"I decided to try the Bikram Yoga Studio in Phoenix and I have to say I am very happy with it.  This location is very conveniently located in Uptown Plaza next to AJ's.  Right off the light rail too.   I've been going for about a month now. My first class was with MJ who I think is awesome!  In fact all the instructors I've had, while all different, are pretty good in their own way.  They are great about keeping to the dialog and explaining the postures, and their benefits. They make sure to keep you reaching for more and I have noticed a major improvement in myself. \n\nThe studio is a good size but I will say I would prefer more studio space and less lobby space since the classes can be pretty large at times.  It's not a deal breaker by any means.   I think the cleanliness is pretty good.  I know past reviews have said it's not which makes me think they may have done something to improve because I don't feel it's bad at all.  But this is a Bikram studio, so not sure what people are expecting. People are sweating non stop all day in there.  For that alone, it's amazing how clean it is. \n\nI like that they supply a cleaner & towels to clean your mat after class.  This is handy and probably helps them make sure the class will have clean mats attending.\n\nThe men's locker room (which is all I can review) is actually very nice.  It's clean, a good size and it has nice cubes for your belongings.\n\nIf I had one compliant it wouldn't really be about the studio itself, but more about some of the new people attending.  I wish they would give the new students upon signing up, a run down of Bikram etiquette.  I have heard far too many people chatting in the studio before the instructor comes in.  Many students use the time before class to quietly meditate and center themselves as they prepare for class. With Groupons coming out, there tend to be a lot of \""first timers\"" so it's important they know the etiquette before they enter the room.  Also leaving the room should be for emergencies only.  We are all dizzy and want to vomit, get past it!  Once a girl walked into class well into our second set of breathing exercises.  That was a little shocking since in most studios that is a huge No No!   When the class starts if you are late...No class for you.   \n\nIt's a great feeling and I am glad I have found something I really enjoy doing.  I am always looking forward to my next class!"	3
139	I haven't been here in quite some time due to the fact that it used to have a pretty crappy reputation for bad customer service, but I recently came to give it another shot since they were bought out about 2+ years ago and wanted to see what the race was all about. I see them all over facebook and on the radio. Needless to say I walked away very impressed! They gave the store a complete make over! It looks great and feels better! The staff was very nice and helpful. Their was some of the same staff there but they had a much better attitude than they used to.\n     They even came out from behind the counter to help me find a holster for my Sig 238. They also carry a lot of new product! Before it was kinda empty and pathetic other than magazines etc. now they are a full 5.11 dealer!!!! I love 5.11! They have the pants the shirtstge bags,(range and rifle cases) even they backpacks! They even have the holsters, attachment for the packs, socks, boots, even the briefs and undershirts!  Their selection of guns was great!! Especially in the gun economy where everything is hard to get. Can you tell I was shocked!! Lol \nAnyways. If you haven't been in for a while or not at all, definitely worth the trip!!  I am glad I did! I will be back for sure! The General Manager even came out to make sure I was being taken care of! Oh yeah I got a new backpack while I was their! The 5.11 rush 24! I travel a lot and love a comfy durable pack! See you soon Discount!!	4
140	"Okay, I admit it.  I am one of those people that goes into a restaurant  I've never been to expecting to hate SOMETHING.  This sometimes translates into bad reviews which SOMETIMES earn me private messages from other reviewers all offended that I called something out in their review.  I would love to give names, and maybe at some point I will.  ANYWAY...\n\nI am perfectly capable of singing the praises of a restaurant.  I've had La Brioche's baked goods before, and they are wonderful.  I wasn't expecting the delicious deliciousness that was my breakfast at \""True Food\"".  I ordered the french toast, and my companion had the eggs benedict.  The french toast had bananas and candied pecans on top, as well as a cream sauce, and came with real maple syrup.  It was a perfect portion to make me full without feeling stuffed.  The bites I had of the eggs benedict were almost too much, it was so good.  The bernaise sauce was lemony, and the eggs had asparagus on top.  \n\nThe decor was fancy without being frou-frou, and the wait staff was friendly.  The explanation in the little \""true food\"" book about the decor and the feng shui was a little pretentious, but whatever.\n\nAnyway, I'll be back.  (this last sentence was said in my mind in a cheesy austrian accent btw)"	4
141	It's Hooters guys... shouldn't expect too much here.\n\nI will say they are somewhat expensive but recently they had all you can eat wings and another special of boneless wing basket on Wed nights and a few friends and me went there every week for that deal with a couple pitchers... but the beer is even pricey.\n\nI do love their boneless wings and their buffalo chicken sandwiches, pickle and tater salad are a good combo.  I don't go super hot but they have a good range of heat and some honey hots and other good stuff - I say mix it up a bit and try em all out.\n\nThe scene is the same though I will say this location has some talent as of late.  You also have the sports know-it-all who got cut his freshman year and never let it go, the affliction wearing douchebag that's never rolled on a mat in his life, and the fat sloppy guy that takes all the pictures with the girls.   Don't get me wrong, there are others in there but just typical those dudes are in there. \n\nThe girls are super nice... obviously.  But they're not gonna date you big guy - just sayin\n\nAlso, as far as I know they do provide the UFC fights for free so it's an okay backup if you don't have anywhere else to watch it.\n\nI don't eat there a lot but it's not bad when I do :)	2
142	Be afraid!	0
143	I was extremely excited to finally eat here! in the end.. I was very disappointed.\n\nMy boyfriend and I love oysters! Being an oyster bar we thought it must be fresh and delicious! Holy crap was the oysters shitty!  We could not believe how dirty the oysters were! They did not take the liberty to rinse or scrub the oysters shells before prying them open.  I do not think they were fresh! We bough a dozen and could barely finish half.. My boyfriend almost yacked up one of them because it was already bad.  It was already hard enough trying to eat the dirty oysters..after eating the bad one we noticed the couple others didn't look good.  The worker at the end never took our plate away until the end asking if we were going to finish it.. yeah we just said no.  There's something wrong there if we did not finish it buddy!  We watched them open the oysters after and saw how dirty the shells were and noticed that the shells had bands around them to keep the oysters from opening.  THIS PLACE IS NOT KNOWN FOR THE OYSTERS!\n\nWe also had New England Clam Chowder and Chicken Gumbo.  These came out a lot better.  I've never had Gumbo but my boyfriend said it was decently good.  I am a fan of clam chowder, and it was good, nothing amazing.  So the rest of the food must be the talk of the joint.\n\nThe service, it was mehhh.  I swear the cook in front of us looked miserable, took some time for us to have a server attend to us the couple times we needed something..\n\nDefinitely will not be back..	1
144	"Just came back from the restaurant tonight.  feel like sharing my experience with people.  The environment was very good.  Its hard to see such scale of restaurant locally.  The server told me that this restaurant cost about 2 million.  Each stove cost about 10 grand.  The smoke was sucked under neath, so your cloth will not smell after the meal. The menu looks pleasant. beautiful pictures.  Service was good.  He changed my grill 4 times during the meal.  These are all the good parts.  Now here comes the food.  the appetizer we ordered was spicy tuna volcano.  of 1 to 5, I will give it a one.  tuna has no flavor, the deep fried rice ball was hard.  two very different textures did not match well at all.  For the BBQ, I ordered scallop, Kalbi, Harami, Tongue, Chicken fondue.  They have 3 kinds of sauce, Ponzu, Sweet Soy, Spicy sauce.  The Ponzu was blend with out a kick or freshness.  The Sweet soy is too sweet that over powers the meat flavor easily, and you can just tell it was thickened by corn starch.  spicy sauce was Korean style base which was still on the sweet side.  So I am not impress with the sauce.  The scallop was fresh and I have no complaint.  But the meat is really just so so.  The reason is that the cut was bad.  some thick, some thin, some stringy, some wide.  they just want to make it to the weight, (which is only 4 to 5 oz. per order) for $9.00!  And they cut the meat along the grain.  which is a huge no no for bbq.  I feel like they want to cut cost by using the end parts and cut the meat any way they can to make the portion.  The marinate was too sweet and overpowering the meat flavor.  However the marinate flavor was not too bad, So if you like Korean bbq style, you will like it but If you like real Japanese BBQ, you should go try Yagyu( the 2 story building by the China town) They do it right.  The chicken, they use breast, which is very dry, and the fondue is just not what I am expecting when I am trying to eat bbq.  The cheese was overpowering.  The chicken was sticking on the grill.  The grill they use is metal, really easy to get blacken by the sweet sauce.  thats why the server has to change it so often(in the middle of your cooking)  I prefer Yagyu's.  They use cast iron grill, you can put a block of beef fat on it to enhance the flavor.  And the chicken will not stick.  Because yagyu is the first \""Japanese\"" bbq place in town, so I compare between the two a lot.  For the draft beer, hands down yagyu is far better.  The mug was stored below freezing.  So when the beer comes, the whole mug is covered with frost and the beer was frozen in side the mug and float to the top.  If you are beer lover, you really have to go try Yagyu's draft beer.  Tonight's beer just looks sad.  And I don't like their rice.  To me, a perfectly cooked rice is just as important as the meat.  because you eat them together.  Rice brand or the type of grain of the rice was not good.  For $1.95 a bowl, they should put out something better.  Over all, for the environment, and if you want to impress some people, they will do the job.  The food is acceptable.  But for the bbq, Yagyu is the way to go."	1
145	Love this salon! Conveniently located in the district. Brandi always does an amazing job on my hair! No matter if I'm going blond, or decide to go totally dark. Not to mention she gives the MOST amazing scalp massage I've ever had! Literally feel like a new person when I leave. I also like how private their little rooms are. Makes girl talk with Brandi that much better, and I don't have to hear all the other conversations going on, and they don't have to hear mine! 5 stars! :)	4
146	"Not a frequent yelper but want to save others from my mistake. This meal was supposed to be the highlight of our Vegas trip- sadly, it was a low point. This would be zero stars but for our friendly waiter and the excellent wine pairings. \n\nAccording to other yelp users, a limo service is offered to take you to and from the restaurant. We were not offered this service and when I called to inquire I was treated as if I was making it up! There was something a little disappointing about dropping 2500 on dinner and having to walk 200 yards through a smoky casino to get to a cab. I also was disappointed that I wasn't offered a dark napkin (or at less a nonpilling one) and that I wasn't given a fresh napkin when I went to the restroom. Minus one star for service. \n\nDecor in the restaurant is odd. Purple and gold and \""opulence, I has it\"". Todd pointed out that the impressionistic art was in contrast to the period decor- I thought it was odd the hostesses were in Asian attire at a traditional french restaurant. Gaudy and odd I can live with, but it carried over to the table setting. There were fake candles and glitter covered\nStyrafoam balls on the table as decorations! And salt and pepper shakers. Can't believe food from the chef of the century would require seasoning. Minus one star for ambiance. \n\nOrdered the 16 course degustation menu. Bread cart,  12 plates and dessert cart. Not one memorable in a good way course. Plating was unattractive at best. There were inedible garnishes- costume jewelry and ribbons. And they taped down the bowls to the serving trays with scotch tape. And to top it off, the cheese cart is not included in the degustation menu! Minus two stars for food. \n\nKicker- up most of the night with stomach issues. If my phone call re: limo service was any indication, my call to inform the restaurant of this will not go well. \n\nOnly bright spot was the $595/person wine pairing. They opened several nice bottles for us to enjoy. They were knowledgeable and enjoyed talking about the wine. The pairings were good, not great, but the wine was so special it made up for it. If I had to go back (I never will) I'd ask for the wine pairing."	0
147	"Seriously, how many F words can you not use on a Yelp review? How do you order app, a salad and three entrees.  Salad came first then bruschetta (wtf) toast and tomatoes and cheese.  Don't give it a sweet name and take 50 minutes to make it.  Also the fact that we order lasagna and you are out of it?  You couldn't tell me that during the 50 mins that you were making bruschetta?  How long does it take to make lasagna?  Wait someone told me longer I'm sorry I didn't go to culinary school, I guess nether did your cooks \""I use cooks loosely\"".\nI would recommend a better Italian place but I'm Scottish, I would say stay home drink beer and make macaroni and cheese!"	0
148	Beautiful rooms and views. Room service is awful. The tuna tartare was tasteless and my quesadilla was so burnt I had to send it back. The room also had a number of technical problems that the staff could not solve, such as the tv in the bedroom not functioning. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel.	1
149	"I contacted the Closet Factory last Monday to arrange for a new master closet design. I spoke to the owner, Abby.  She indicated she would have a designer contact me.  By Sunday with no contact, I left a message which prompted a call back from Abby today.  She informed me that it would take another week for a designer to get back to me, that they are scheduling installs the week prior to my completion date which means if I wait another week for a call then I couldn't make my completion, and if I want any hard wood it would take 5 to 6 weeks.  I asked if my only option was to wait for the one designer who has my \""territory\"" and she said yes.  I guess she must be doing very well to turn away business."	0
150	Stopped by for a quick couple of wings and some ice tea. The waitress took our order and sent it off to the kitchen. When the server came out with our order it was completely wrong. The manager came out and did an excellent job of making everything correct and even took 15% off the bill. I like Buffalo wild wing, and I was pleased to see that the manager has the ability to correct things. We are a loyal customer and will continue to go to Buffalo wild wing at McQueen and Elliot!	3
151	I probably eat here way too much. But dang, it's so delicious! The club is the best! The staff is great; always friendly and efficient.	4
152	"Awful pizza. Boring. Bland. Tasteless. \nI didn't even finish it.\n\nWhat's the deal with the all the good reviews for this chain? Doesn't make any sense to me.\n\nThe sauce is watery and acidic. The crust is tough and flavorless.\nAnd yet, the place was packed when I was there....really packed!!!\nCould be another sign of the apocalypse.\n\nThis \""coal-fired, brick-oven\"" hustle is meaningless. \nDoesn't make this much better than Papa John's. But costs twice as much. Not that I'm recommending Papa John's cuz I'm not.\nBut I am saying there are many pizza choices in Las Vegas that are better than Grimaldis. Including the newly-opened Dom DeMarco's.\n\nBut for me, the little neighborhood joint on Twain called Sicili, will do just fine.\n\nDon't waste your time on this place; leave it for the pizza muggles.\n(If you don't know what a 'pizza muggle' is, just read the other reviews.)"	0
153	First time in Vegas and I stayed here. Decent room loved the set up of the gambling floor. Awesome restaurants and friendly staff. I would come here again.	3
154	"Easily the worst restaurant we ate at in Montreal.\nWe started with oysters. They looked shriveled and off-color, one appeared so butchered we didn't want to eat it.\nI ordered the salad from the Table d'h\u00f4te \""Gastro\"" menu. It was just rocket with too much dressing and small raisins which just fell through to the bottom of the plate (gravity always wins).\nThe fish was dry and overcooked and the \""risotto\"" was just mushy under-cooked rice.\nWe also heard a microwave beep 7 or 8 times while we ate and there was an ant on our bread.\nI feel like I got hustled out of $150."	0
155	As a local, it would make ZERO sense for me to go to Planet Hollywood for a sandwich. So my 5 star rating shouldn't be misconstrued as me saying I would frequent them all the time, but rather based on convenience and price compared to what you typically find in a Las Vegas casino. At $6 you would be hard pressed to find a better sandwich on the Vegas strip. Is it the best sandwich I have ever had? Certainly not. However, with warm bread, tasty meat and relatively quick service... you can't beat Earl of Sandwich. Added bonus is that it is directly across from the Sports Book... grab a sandwich and go sit and watch a game. \nI agree with Misti that they have a major lack of options for not only bread but toppings and sauces. No oil and vinegar? How does a sandwich shop not have oil and vinegar?\nSandwich is not overly filling, which could be either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Heading to see Peepshow? Probably don't want to sit through that on an overstuffed stomach! Grab some Earl and you will be good to go!\nI order the Full Montague (I believe) which has turkey and roast beef. Consistently good and they have not messed up an order of mine yet.	4
156	Wow this is a really nice place. I've never visited this cinema before, but I was surprised. The restrooms are clean and modern, the theatre is a great size and they have a great selection at the snack bar. I will go back to this theatre for sure.	3
157	Five stars because it's a place were comfort food meets a classy and friendly atmosphere, meets a perfect and very attentive service. The duck breast was spectacular, I'd totally recommend having the duck. It took them longer than expected to bring us the starters and they came separately, and they took them off the bill. We were definitely delighted by great food and a great service.	4
158	I keep trying to give this location a chance but each time I'm dissapointed. This place tries to save money and I'm doing that the customer ends up getting a raw deal. The meat is old, the veggies look horrible and the place just can't seem to get it rite. I've had it with this pale and will never buy a sandwich here again. Don't try and save money but yet and still charge the customer  the same price for old meat and veggies. Shame on this place!!!!	0
159	"So happy that they decided to open up a Komex on my side of town!! Always a good place to go to for a quick bite. I also come here when I wanna introduce this place to people from out of town or if they've never been here before. I come here strictly for the fusion tacos. The spicy pork tacos are my favorite. Delicious!!! I have tried some of the other items on the menu on the other hand. They're alright.. nothing too \""fusiony\"" or special I would say"	3
160	Both times I've eaten breakfast here, I was extremely, extremely pleased. However, I think the food was better my first visit compared to the second, and I'm not one to branch out at breakfast places, so this is a fair comparison of the exact same sandwich, service, and company. \n\nEach visit we waited in line outside of Deluca's for a table. It was raining, but the line moved quickly and we were under cover anyways. The service is prompt and friendly. \n\nIt's definitely a great place to recommend to out of towners for a good local breakfast stop. The bread is all Mancini's...delicious. Local flavor, great location. Will return.	3
161	We went in for lunch and were the only customers. Bollocks.  Never a good sign.  \n\nThe were some hits and some misses.  We took the recommendations of the sushi chef.  After all, they should know best!  Hmmmm, not the case.  \n\nThe crab/mango salad was boring.  The hamachi was fresh but once again, lacked any pizzazz.  The crispy fried chicken was yummy (but that's a hard one to mess up).  My sake sangria was a disappointment.  It had a cough syrup sort of flavor.  \n\nThe prices were high.  Luckily we had a groupon.  \n\nService was great.  Everyone was very friendly and nice.  Restaurant was clean.  Very strange that they have a long bar with stools facing the wall.  Who wants to dine staring at a blank wall?\n\nBottom line - you may get some A-OK food with nice service, but you can defniitely find better Sushi/Hawaiin fusion for cheaper elsewhere.	1
162	"I am giving one star for a reason...  I used to love this place, food quality was good and service was great.  But that all change today, and it was unbelievable what the server had told me.  The Nigiri was not fresh today, food was ok.  The service I would give 0 star if I could.  Every time we are trying to order, the server always give us this bad look.  And we don't really eat that much, trust me.  The worst part was the server lie to us in our face saying there is a limit of the Ice Cream per person...  Which is not true and I told her I have been here plenty time.  She immediate change her story saying it is not limited \""BUT I THINK EACH OF YOU HAVE 1 MOCHI ICE CREAM AND 1 REGULAR ICE CREAM I THINK THATS ENOUGH FOR YOU GUYS\""  I seriously start to laugh and tell her forget about it.  And this is my first time in my life left a $0 tips.  I thought it's AYCE!!!!  As a business owner, I feel sorry for Sushi Wa owner to have staff like that."	0
163	Its americanized, but pretty tasty! I love the fried rice and usually just get that. We were getting takeout once and waited at the bar, and the bartender gave us free tastes of the lychee cocktail while we waited! And that was tasty too!\n\nIts also never crowded, its quiet and the service is consistently not bad. \n\nAll that being said though, there isn't really anything special about this place. Its just kind of...eh... Best as take out.	2
164	"Dropped in here for lunch a little after 11 & this mid-sized place was already almost full of lively customers!  After getting situated in a comfortable booth, I was brought a basket of chips & excellent salsa!\n\nMy #1 Lunch Combo arrived in good time, & in this case consisted of a hard-shell peccadillo beef taco, a beef tamale, & a tostada.  The food was good, particularly the tamale, & my only complaint about the place is that I'm not crazy about the menu combination choices they have.  (I would have liked a combo with a Chile Relleno & something else, but the \""something else\"" would have been an expensive ala carte item.)\n\nThe service was friendly, & the price for my meal very reasonable at $5.50.  No wonder they're busy!    :-)"	2
165	Cheap sushi. Good sized, especially considering the price. The raw rolls tasted decent, although heavily seasoned. Leaves one to wonder why. Rice was almost dessert level sweet.  I've never had to throw out sushi until this place. Ate a few pieces of my rolls and just couldn't continue. Giving them a second star due to the cheap prices. If you want cheap sushi and aren't picky about the quality, then give this place a swirl...otherwise, I wouldn't bother.	1
166	Food City has the absolute BEST prices on produce that I've ever seen anywhere in AZ, CA, or HI. When I first saw the Wednesday circular advertising avocados 5/$.99 and 8 lbs. of roma tomatoes for $.99, I knew that there had to be a catch. I scurried down to Avondale as fast as my little honda could take me, and alas, the ad was real, and I scored 4 massive bags of produce for a whopping.... $12. You have to buy what's on sale, and I haven't bought much here other than produce, as I don't find their grocery prices to be outstanding, but for fruits and veggies, there's no better place IMHO. \n\nAs an added bonus, with all of the Mexican music playing throughout the store, I'm learning a little bit of Spanish. Ole!	3
167	A night out!\n\nCiopinno with marinara. Antipasto (without any salad). Minestrone soup. Spinach salad with grilled salmon.\n\nWhat a spread!\n\nThe decor is artsy and tasteful. The service is above average. It's a great starter to evening.	2
168	I don't understand all the good reviews here. The hibachi here is like avg mall food court quality. I guess if you want quantity over taste, this place does ok then.	1
169	Short and to the point: The food is good. Littleneck clams as steamers for about $11 a dozen. Moose Drool on tap.	3
170	"Very dissatisfied. Tried to use their car wash today. I pulled up until the red light told me to stop. During the first pass of the arms they hit the back of my car causing a small scratch. The arms then just stopped. I went in to tell them. Despite three people in uniform standing there no one knew how to \""reset\"" the arms. They also refused to refund my money. I was told \""we don't do that. Here is a code to use the car wash when it is working again. You need to use it within a week\"" so they want me to go back and use the same horrible cheap car wash that already scratched the back of my car. The scratch is really small but it is the principle of it. For the record my car is not huge it is a Rav 4, so a really small SUV. DO NOT USE THIS CARWASH."	0
171	Maybe I'm a cynic, but I don't see why everyone gets quite as excited as they do about this shop.\n\nPut it this way; if I were a bank manager and someone came to me asking for money to start a business, and I asked them what type of business, and they answered that they were going to open a shop selling anything and everything that's white, I'd laugh them out of my office.\n\nBut I'm not a bank manager, and I would clearly have been wrong to do that, as it's now an internationally renowned and hugely successful chain. But I still think it's a bit overrated.\n\nYes, the quality's good and the service is generally friendly and efficient, but that's also the case in places like John Lewis where they also sell soft funishings in other colours too. Although I have from here before (I'm a bit of a sucker for a designer label) I don't do it regularly.	2
172	This airport doesn't have a lot of good food options, but would consider this place one of the better options if you have some time to kill.  Typical airport prices and okay bar food, but good service.	2
173	Rip off they suck !! My nails aren't even the right shape some are bigger then the other don't let the fool you if you ask for your nails a little narrow but still square at the end they'll tell you it's 5 DALLORS more ?? FOR WHAT ITS STILL SQUARE I JUST WANTED IT NOT SO WIDE .. They suck you'll find cheaper and way better	0
174	Not bad. While the wifey and I only tried breakfast, the rest of the menu looked interesting (like Salmon pizza). It was fairly decent, I feasted on the Eggs Any Style breakfast and the misses ordered the smoked salmon bagel sandwich. The smoked salmon was a hit and the Eggs any style was just as you would expect. The eggs any style comes with homestyle potatoes (good stuff!), meat and toast...pretty fulfilling. Prices are high, but you should expect it for the convenience and city location.\n\nUpdate: 1/24/11\n\nI recently revisited this deli and I'll keep it at three stars.  They took the Salmon Bagel sandwich off the menu, but now offer it in a DIY boxed version which is still good! My kids had the french toast which I sampled and it was awesome! It came with white chocolate additions and a really good whip cream topping! This french toast is a must have!!!!	2
175	Downhill is the key word - I don't know what happened to this particular location but I am shocked they stay open. The crab cakes are abysmal and just about everything else is at best mediocre. Spare yourself and go elsewhere.	1
176	Over the last 8-9 years, I've flown into the Vegas airport numerous times. Not because I'm a big party animal, but because I have family who lives there. It's always funny to see people's reaction when I tell them I go there to visit my niece/nephew and not to party or gamble. They just can't seem to comprehend it...\n\nAnyhoo, this airport is fine for what it is. It has a worn down feel to it. Not sure if the slot machines are a pro or con, since I'm not a gambler. And the restaurant options leave much to be desired.\n\nHowever, this airport isn't BAD, either. Security is generally amiable. Flights are generally on-time no matter which airline you fly. I guess there really aren't many weather issues here (vs. fog in SFO or snow in Denver). If you check your bag, it's pretty easy to find the carousel that you need. And if someone is picking you up, parking in the garage is cheap ($2/hour) and the drive-by pickup is easy too.\n\nI don't cringe when booking a flight into McCarran, but I don't necessarily jump up and down with excitement, either. It's just a means to an end in my world.	2
177	When this first opened the food was good. Now it tastes like everything came from the freezer. The food is just okay now but not for the price.	1
178	We tried it and liked it.  I thought it was better than most!  Traditional Mexican food and plenty of seafood options - or at least more than most.  It's always crowded and was recommended to us by an Arrowhead resident.	3
179	Thank goodness I had a DealChicken offer that got us in at 2-4-1.  Otherwise, I would have felt like we were seriously ripped off!  We park and get in the long line of what i thought was the line to get in.  Something told me to walk ahead towards the gate.  I told J to stay in line, just in case.  I walked ahead and finally see some signs...which were about 25 yards (100+ people) from where J was standing. Those signs stated that people that already had tickets/vouchers could go straight to the gate, so I flagged J down to come on up.  We get to the gate and get in pretty quickly. I'm glad I walked ahead, cause I know I would have been pissed to have to stand in that line for nothing. \n\nPretty much everything from that point kinda just went downhill.  \n\nWe walk over to get tokens.  A little voice in my head as we were driving there told me to stop off at the bank.  But I ignored the voice.  Maybe because part of me figured why wouldn't an event like this NOT have Square, so you'd be able to use your credit/debit card.  Should have listened to the voice.  I was informed they only took cash for tokens.  I had $10 on me (which is rare, I never carry cash), so we got 5 tokens.  \n\nWe walk around for a few minutes and decide to stop at one stand due to there not being a long line.  Word to the wise, the longer the line - the better the food.  No line usually equates to..umm...slop.  See taco photo.  The vendor that we got the bad tacos from had mac and cheese that wasn't too bad though.  But we were at the TACO FESTIVAL.  Not the mac and cheese festival.  :(\n\nLiterally no shade and definitely no seats to be found, unless you were purchased VIP tickets.  Sadly, this is the 3rd S.R.Fs event that we've gone to where we've been completely disappointed.  And honestly, this just seemed like an excuse for some to start drinking before noon and get piss drunk. \n\nTotal Time Spent at the Taco Festival = 30 minutes\nTotal Spent = $16 (thank gawd we didn't have to pay for parking)\nWill We Attend Another Taco Festival = Nope.	0
180	Britney doesnt sing , dubbed, (which we knew and didnt care) however no big screen to see when far away, which we were also not far away but could not see very well.  Also Briteny DID NOT show any effort or enthusiam about being there and her dancing was WAY less adequate than her actual dancers who were amazing by the way.  However I did not pay to see her dancers.  I was very dissapointed about paying that amount of money for what we actually recieved.  The worst was the fact it was abvious she was not performing, she was going through the actions.	0

182	worst restaurant.it is no way comparable with Malaya cuisine in elizabeth uptown charlotte.The malaysian fried rice which I ordered looked like old and smelled really bad.I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody.If you want Malaysian food I will recommend the Malaya cusine in elizabeth near CPCC central campus.	0
183	"So my friend really wanted a bbq place on our way out of LV. And she's heard of this place and though it would have been good. No it was bad. The ribs i got were dry. The ends were really bad and we'd though that if we get closer to the center it would be juicier. nope so we asked is this normal for them. The server said no the manager said yes. What really pissed me off was when he said \""you don't know what dry rub ribs are like\"" \""you don't know what smoke ribs is supposed to be like\""\n  Ok granted i don't work at a bbq and yeah i don't live out in memphis. But dam it don't assume s*** about me. When you cook at a low temp for a long period of time it's to keep it juice and give it some smoke flavor. Not dried out jerky! They would have gotten a 2 maybe 3 stars from me. But mister manager you drove it over the top with your insulting comments."	0
184	Kona is average.  It's a tough area!  There are soooooo many good sushi places in Old Town/Downtown area---Kona usually does not compare.  \n\nThe food is just okay.   They are not bad, but they are not great either.   Price points are on the high side.  The service is fine.  If you are in the mall, and want sushi, I'd say go to Kona.  You will have a good experience.  But if you aren't already at the mall, their are many places in the town where you can have a great experience.	3
185	I'm only giving this four stars because I'm comparing it to other shows such as O and Le Reve but if I didn't know any better, it would have given five stars! \n\nThis is a really good show with lots of acrobats and fight sequences.  Get ready to have your mind blown when the stage raises and rotates! There's an Asian influence in this show with dragons and fight scenes.  It's definitely more of a story and the show flows more than the usual Cirque show with a bunch of amazing circus acts, interrupted by French clowns.  I fucking hate clowns.	3
186	We used to receive several buy one get one free coupons with purchase of two beverages, but now they are just buy 1 get 1 half with two beverages. Their breakfast is tasty, but without the coupon a little pricey. We used our coupon for dinner once, but it was still way too expensive, and the food was just mediocre. The service was ok, but very dusty, and outdated decor. Has lots of potential though. Not sure if we will be back.	2
187	LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL! After experiencing this festival, this is how you will feel. It's better than any artificial high you can buy. A magical gathering of people infused with a plethora of art, culinary delights, learning, and live music. \n\nI've been to several music festivals: big and small. Life Is Beautiful is my all-time favorite. Imagine a 3-day festival in the heart of historic downtown Las Vegas. It makes navigating the space a cake walk because it's set up on a grid. The two main stages were on opposite sides of the grounds; each with a separate culinary village attached.\n\nI'm not really sure what the parking nightmare was like, thankfully my sister works downtown and let me borrow her parking pass at a structure near downtown; although Saturday night I was camped in the garage for 2 hours. Since this festival is in the heart of downtown, my group of friends grabbed some beers (and I a lemonade) at Park on Fremont and see-sawed for a bit.\n\nBeing that this Festival is still in it's infancy, being only it's second year there are still kinks that need to be worked out. The motivational speakers were crammed into this small space. Lining up for 30 minutes prior to a session and not being able to get in was beyond frustrating; however, I got over it quickly. My best festival memories come from getting lost in the experience rather than rushing to catch a certain set. \n\nMy favorite memory was the ferris wheel ride on night 3. We were the first loading on, as soon as we made a full 360, Foo Fighter started. One of those, what is life moments. I love taking in the views from on the top of the solo ride. Overlooking the entire festival. Seeing all the people there, all experiencing the same thing, you can't help but feel connected to your fellow ladies and gents. I'm still smiling from my memories made there.\n\nCan't wait to go back!	4
188	The star for the hustle of this place. Wasn't crazy busy but I noticed there were many things that went wrong with not just my order, but other tables. I felt bad and I didn't want to give them a hard time, so I waited patiently for my food that I called in for pick-up. Upon arrival, my food was handed to someone else. I waited for about 15 minutes before getting my bag, but as I was walking out noticed that it was missing my smash fries. So I went back in and waited maybe another 7 minutes. The manager was apologetic and so was the cashier, but as I saw them offer the table next to me free entree passes, etc. and another table the same thing, I wasn't offered it after the two mistakes. It was a bummer.	0
189	Well, what to say... Almost all the reviewers have hit the nail on the head.  If you love poke, think you might want to try poke, don't event know what poke is - go to Poke Express and fall in love with some of the best poke on the planet.  And great prices to boot.\n\nIf its your first time, its a little confusing to figure out - since its really 3 restaurants under one roof.  Only problem is their hours - they close too early	3
190	I do not go to Fresh and Easy very much.  The stores just aren't appealing to me except for a couple of items--generally snacks.  They have peanut butter filled salted pretzel nubs, some good salted kettle chips, and very decent trail mix for hiking.\n\nThat's about it for me.  I was going by here yesterday and thought it would be a quick and easy stop and it was.  Since I have no preconceived notion where things should be, I just walk around like a zombie with a purpose to find what I want.\n\nCheckout was quick--I only had two items, and then I went across the street to Albertsons where I did a bit more serious shopping.	2
191	Good beer selection, food was just ok and wait staff was rather unfriendly. Probably won't be going back.	1
192	I wanted to love this place, really love this place, but it just wouldn't let me. There was something off, not too bad, but just off. People were nice, food was as good as other Italian places (except Portofino's of course). The service was good, the line wasn't too long. Anyway,it's in a nice spot, around the corner from Williams and Sonoma. So a little shopping and a little dinner. Maybe more shopping than dinner.	2
193	The tacos are great but the system sucks big time. You have to wait in three different lines if you want three different types of tacos and don't get me started if it's a Friday! C'mon people, modernize and make it one line for everything! 3 stars is all I can give you guys until you change your system.	2
194	If you are a Duck enthusiast, go there and as well fries cooked in duck fat, best fries I ever ate.	3
195	The staff were friendly enough and the place looked nice. I had a green curry with chicken it came filled with vegetables and a good size serving BUT as other reviews have noted, peas have no place in a curry. They tasted weird and out of place. And the deal breaker for me was the curry itself. The chicken had a greyish blue tinge because the curry quite obviously had some sort of food dye in it. It was a bright minty green. If you make this using proper ingredients you don't need to do this. It had a thai-ish taste but clearly not well made. Disappointing and unappetising.	1
196	Westrige mall was better than this mall even when most of the stores were about to shut down. When I visited this mall recently most the stores looked cluttered and unkept.	0
197	"I honestly can't say I've been to a worse cycle store. I've dealt with this place in both parts and service and they get nothing right. I've ordered parts that, after explaining in detail what I need, had the wrong part ordered. \""I know exactly what you're talking about.\"" Famous last words. Common parts that they don't even stock. \n\nI took my bike there to have a service done. The guy told me there would be a wait because they have so much work ahead of my bike. I'm patient, but after almost 2 weeks, right when I'm about to call, I get a LETTER IN THE MAIL saying they DON'T HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER to contact me. I called them and they not only had a number, but the RIGHT NUMBER. I had to wait for something in the mail when these guys had my number. The service guy said it was some woman's number. I called my number from work. It was the generic computer voice. Yes, a female computer voice. \n\nWhen I called back a couple of days later, he said he'd been trying to call that number, but it still didn't work. Every phone I used reached my phone. Two days later, the one person in a motorcycle store who knows how to use a phone called me (same number) to tell me the bike is ready. This is THREE WEEKS LATER. To make up for it, they took a couple bucks off the bill. \n\nNow I have a motorcycle that I'm going to have to piece together after having to take it apart and learn how to FIX WHAT THEY BROKE. Loose hoses, incomplete work, garage full of pulled apart  motorcycle pieces. It was an expensive lesson to learn, but I will NEVER set foot in this place again and will steer any friend I have away from this DUMP."	0
198	Don't waste your time.  It used to be good.  It's not anymore.	0
199	"My coworker and I came here after a busy nightshift. Overall the food was good (we both ordered the chicken fried steak) but the service was poor. The gentleman clearing tables was rude and told us they were \""too busy\"" to allow us to sit on the empty corner table and made us squish in between other parties. After a crazy shift this is definitely not the place to unwind! \n\nOur waiter was not very attentive and my coworker was never offered a refill on her diet coke the whole time we were there. The food was alright, but nothing spectacular. I wish I would've tried the Pumpkin French Toast. I told myself I would get it next time....at this point I'm not sure if we will go so far out of our way again. There are better breakfast joints much closer."	1
200	Hmmm if I ever go back to Pittsburgh maybe I will be able to check out the Strip when there's actually people around - it was pretty empty when we were there, unfortunately.  There were at least a few coffee shops around and one over-priced chocolate shop, not much else though that I saw in the way of anything interesting.  Maybe we were on the wrong street or maybe just bad timing.	2
201	Waited 15 minutes at hostess stand to be seated, no one showed. Sat ourselves at the bar amongst other guests, where a manager was stocking beer. No greeting from manager even. Wait another 10 minutes to see other guests looking around for service as well, but no showing of a bartender, server or even the previously seen manager. Sad showing from such high expectations.	0
202	I was here for about 10 minutes bc we were roaming through all the Palms clubs/bars and I really liked it. The place is definitely tiny compared to the other clubs around but the music was good and I loved the huge booth seating. Also, their patio is pretty big and the view is nice. I'd definitely come back here to start off the night.	2
203	I love this wee place. Edinburgh has done well to preserve the old school pubs in the city centre so that they can be enjoyed by new generations. The Rose St Brewery is very quaint, the upstairs lounge is my favourite part of the pub. Carpeted floors and old pictures of the city line the walls. A plaque boasts it as being the Pub of The Year in 1985.\n\nI popped in for lunch here and ordered a goats cheese salad - very unlike me as I'm a huge carnivore, however it sounded light and refreshing on the menu, and light and refreshing it was. It came with two huge chunks of goats cheese on a bed of mix salad leaves and seasonal veg with a light dressing. With a nice Guinness this it hit the spot perfectly. Staff could have been a bit more attentive, though I doubt they get much training. Nevertheless it is a boozer, so expect nothing more! Kudos Rose St Brewery, and don't ever change!	2
204	I was looking forward to shopping here. I miss Bevmo since moving to Vegas and from what I'd seen on TV, Lee's was the closest thing.  \n\nThe store, while a bit dark, was really neatly organized. I liked the low shelves, so it's easy to see across the store and find what you need.  I thought the shelves were well-faced and they had a huge selection of everything.  The pricing looked average.\n\nBut what really turned me off was that upon entering around 5pm on a Friday, the store was empty save one other patron and a handful of employees, all of which were standing around the main aisle, kibbitzing and shooting the bull. \n\nWe entered the store, walked through this gaggle of gabbers without so much as an acknowledgment.  In fact, a guy who walked in behind us (but was clearly not WITH us) was greeted, but I wasn't. In fact, one of the men made a point of looking over my head , PAST me, when I was right in front of him, to greet the guy behind me. No one else stopped talking or made any eye contact with us.\n\nThis really pisses me off. This is my first experience with your business.  Heaven forbid I interrupt your employees' conversation!  \n\nLook, I don't like to be hassled when I shop, so I don't need you to have a Walmart greeter.  What I would have preferred is that one person standing there had looked me in the eye, said hello or offered to help me find what I needed.  If the they had been busy with customers, I absolutely would not be even discussing this, but they were standing around doing nothing.\n\nTo make matters worse, we had to walk through them 3 more times, once to look for something else, once to go back where we came from and finally, once more to LEAVE when I realized I had no intention of giving them my business that day.	1
205	"I was SO SO SO excited that Istanbul Grill found a new home! It was heartbreaking when they were kicked out of their old space. But this felt like an adventure. If you don't work at the Steel Building, or you aren't familiar with the underbelly of the building like me, you might be completely lost. Especially if the security guard hasn't even heard of the business!\n\nWhen finally found, it was pure joy! Although it doesn't look like they have quite the room or set-up they used to, I will admit it looks a little cleaner (which is a good thing). I was pumped to get my normal chicken salad with beets, white sauce and two grape leaves, all for $10 bucks! And the massive amount they give you, my lord, you could eat for two days!\n\nNow, while it was still delicious, one thing I noticed was that my chicken had to be bottom of the barrel chicken. A lot of it was overcooked and too hard to even eat. Bummer. Why would I go back? Because I know it's still awesome and I'm crossing my fingers this was an \""off\"" day. That's how much I love this place! Five star experience hopefully next time..."	3
206	I met my friend Sam here. I read Gabi's review and I thought I should try this out. The place was neat and the people were friendly which put a smile on my face :)\n\nI wish they had more selection on their menu, but all in all, it was a good experience. \n\nWouldn't mind coming here again and just relax with a cup of java. \n\nThey have free Wifi for those people who can't part with their laptops. Lots and lots of comfy chair to lounge around which is absent in most of the independent coffee shops, YAY for that!	2
207	Thoroughly unimpressed.  Very weak salsa selection. The red salsa reminded me of Taco Bell. The strawberry margarita was AWFUL!!!  Definitely won't be back. \nWant some good Mexican food?  Come up to Pinetop and go to Los Corrales.	0
208	This place was HORRENDOUS! \n\nMy husband and I were in town for the Canadian GP and I knew all the restaurants downtown would be swamped. So I went on Yelp and found a place that took online reservations so I booked a table and off we went. \n\nWe were seated right away but then waited....and waited...and waited some more for our server. The people at the table next us actually made a comment saying how they had to wait for everything during their meal  and the server was awful...turns out we had the same server! Sure enough, we had to wait for drinks, wait for our food, checks etc. Our server would just disappear for 10 mins at a time. It was pretty bad.\n\nIn addition, they changed the menu that weekend., so we thought we are going into a reasonable priced place with pizza options, no big deal. But no, this new menu was very expensive! $15-$10 apps and $30 entrees...no pizzas anywhere on the menu. \n\nBut we were there already so we decided to stay and order. The food was actually pretty good. The salmon tartar was wonderful, but still a bit overpriced for what it was. What  REALLY pissed me off though was that I ordered the truffled risotto, as did the rich looking guy with 4 girls at his table next to us, except when his came out the host came over and shaved some truffle on to his risotto! But none for me. Seriously, I was livid. \n\nI much also mention that Im sure this was the local hooker hang out. Words truly cannot describe the type of crowd that was hanging out here. I mean, these girls weren't just there to party, there was something about them, and the men they were with, the screamed hooker. It was actually comical. The place was like a caricature of a modern day whore house.\n\nWe tried not to let this place ruin our night so we just laughed it off but then to top off the whole ridiculous thing, when I check my voicemail later that night, I had a message from them saying that they got my reservation but they were booked and not to come.  Never again.	0
209	Great locations, forget the rest! It's old! I will not stay there again	0
210	I would go back.\n\nReminds me of a mom n pop stop.  People were friendly, service was pretty good.  The food wasn't anything to write home about but I did enjoy my meal.  I liked the casual setting and it's in a convenient complex with plenty of parking.	2
211	I was so excited to go here after reading all the reviews, but afterwards wondered if I really had the right place or if it was an off day last Sunday. My experience was very different. We went for a late breakfast. It's best if I summarize my plate. The eggs that I ordered over hard had broken and it was hard to even see the yolks, mixed in as they were. The hamburger patty was the driest, least appetizing I've ever had and even the pancakes were heavy, flat without any taste or salt. I thought it would be hard to mess up these basics but you learn something new every day. The service was nothing exceptional.  I thought the place would have some charm, but there was nothing - just an ordinary diner. It's actually kind of sad when you enjoy the toast with jam more than anything else. Never again. It may be cheap but IMO it's misplaced economics to pay anything for something so disappointing.	0
212	The service is very very slow. The server is on her first rotation by herself with a group of 17, WTF. The food was cold, no other server or manager came to help her out. I finally had to complain after 1 1/2 hours to the manager. I will never go here again.	0
213	Vom Fass is a charming little shop specializing in infused oils, vinegars, liqueurs, and liquors. If you are looking for unique gift ideas, this is an excellent place to start. The staff is friendly, helpful, and eager to assist, and customers are encouraged to sample the products before purchasing. \n\nI do have a few complaints, however. The bottles, although corked and sealed with wax, do have a tendency to leak. I purchased two bottles of oil as a present for my mother, and when she opened them, the bottles and the cellophane in which they were wrapped were coated with a layer of oil. Not much of the product was lost due to the leakage, but it was messy, and for the price that I paid for both the bottles and the contents, it was disappointing. The bottles themselves are quite pricey (not including the price of the product), but if you don't want to spend money on them the next go-round, you can simply wash and dry them and bring them back to be refilled. I am also not a fan of the writing on the bottles after purchase; employees use a white marker to write the contents and volume of the bottle on it, and in my opinion, it looks messy and cheap. \n\nProducts range from basic, traditional olive oil to higher-end oils, to sherries and vinegars, and there is a decent supply of alcohol from local suppliers, too. My favorite purchase to date is the rosemary-infused olive oil. I have also bought a wonderful raspberry vinegar here.\n\nYes, Vom Fass is pricey, but as the product is not necessarily intended for everyday use, it is worth a visit.	3
214	Great food, great service, nice ambience, and reasonable prices (for the Strip). So far, this is the best Chinese restaurant I've found on the strip in a resort.	3
215	Was in the area today and had lunch with a colleague here.  I ordered the 12 Piece Chicken Nachos.\n\nThey were very good.  I thought the proportion of all of the toppings on each chip was perfect.  The portion was good, I wasn't too full and not left hungry.  The Salsa was too weak for my tastes and the Jalapenos weren't spicy at all.  If I could change two things it would be to offer a spicier Salsa option and offer a spicier Jalapeno option.\n\nWill I return?  Sure.	2
216	Went to Vegas a bit TOO much but I wanted to take my brother there (family trip this time) and it was CLOSED! M&M world is 24 hours (or pretty much 24 hours) but this place was closed by like 4PM...boo!	2
217	"Holy SMOKE, this place had so much cigarrette smoke in the air it looked hazy.  It made the dining less enjoyable.  We went for the famous \""Steak Special\"". And I must say it was pretty darn good.  The green beans and mash potatoes that accompanied it was enjoyable as well."	2
218	The price is pretty standard for Las Vegas, but I have to say, they have great seafood options - and, importantly, they're all natural/organic caught/grown etc.  They have great fresh oysters from multiple locations, and I actually had the best sushi I've ever had here.	4
219	This restaurant is a class act from top to bottom! My gf and I have ate here around 10 plus xxx, we have requested Carl as our server each time, he is great, never disappoints. Food and service are top notch, definitely my favorite steak house in Vegas! ---8 yr resident	4
220	I couldn't see what people are raving about this place? Oh I take it back. Perhaps it's the crazy portion of the banana split? Or the fudge sundae. Otherwise, it would just be a regular diner's style treats. We waited too long for a table and didn't have any good memory of it. 1 star goes for the cool venue in Caesars Palace, and the other star goes to the cool looking menu.	1
221	We went there bought some BBQ pork to-go. I did not look at price/LB on the wall. We were charged $7.89 for them. We took them home and decided to weight them on our digital scale out of curiosity. The scale showed only a little over 12 oz. That would be make them $10/LB which is ridiculous. I think either they over weight the pork or over charge us. \n\nThe worse part of this was the BBQ pork was tasteless. \n\nI don't think I would go there again.	0
222	Wonderful experience!	4
223	Nice theatre. Service was great food was good. Doors opened late staff at the door has MAJOR attitude. How about some smiles and friendly greetings to welcome your paying guests?	2
224	I was expecting it to be better. I got a brownie and a cream puff and both were average. I've had better at a supermarket. I love cake boss so I was hoping this would be good. I'll just stick to the cupcakery for my baked goods.	1
225	Great brunch!!  I had a lobster omelette.  We were in a rush and they got our orders out very quickly and were extremely nice.  Will definitely go here again when I'm in the area.	4
226	Four of us went at 7:00pm on a Wednesday night and it was busy with a wait list. We forgot to call ahead and so we went to the bar area to wait (which was also full). There is an outside patio area off of the bar, but we chose to stay inside. We did not have to wait very long (20 minutes). The staff was friendly and efficient. Our appetizers were delicious and I ordered the lemon-grass shrimp as my entree (one of my Favs). The manager came back and apologized that they were out of that dish, so I ordered the Ginger Salmon. He then sent us some complimentary shrimp dishes! I was so full that I took home the salmon for dinner the next evening (it was delicious)! I really appreciated the extra effort they made.	3
227	What an adorable place!?!  Cibo is most definitely an oh-so-hip hidden pizzeria gem tucked away a little off the beaten path from central downtown Phoenix.  [This could very easily be a pizza joint found in any neighborhood in San Francisco.]  Picture this: soft, low lighting, faint, hip music playing overhead, ecclectic flair for decorations, friendly staff, amazing aromas wafting from the kitchen -- my heart was all a flutter from the moment I walked in.\n\nI came here based off of a recommendation of one of my best friends and absolutely loved the Quattro Formaggi pizza; the gorgonzola cheese gave the pie a full-bodied flavor.  Trust me, it's a must for all you cheese-lovers out there like me.  ;-)\n\nI would most definitely come back here on my next trip to Phoenix!	4
228	Super fun definitely a place I will love bringing my baby. I did thought think that it was bs that you pay 150 for a cabana but you still have to pay full admission to get in. That was pretty disappointing. The inner tubes used to be free and now they want 5-10$ for them. So they charge for everything and anything now. But other than that the rides were a lot of fun. I hope they expand the parking.	2
229	I love DB! I am consistently served great tasting coffee with superior customer service!  I have no complaints. I was already in love with DB, and then I saw the special on Undercover Boss, and it confirmed my appreciation for this business. Had I known about this company when I was in high school, I would have worked for them!	4
230	I'm dropping five stars for Grimaldi's for the total experience. Not only is the pizza delicious, but the decor is fresh and modern with a warm and inviting feel. The kitchen is open air at one end of the main room, with plenty of seating, and a good sized full bar at the other end. The service is quick, with very friendly and accommodating staff. Now to the food and drink. I had the Santan Brew Devil's Ale because they were out of the IPA, but I was pleased to find that the Devil was still hoppy and a good pairing with pizza... flavorful but not too strong. The pizza... man oh man the pizza. Definitely the best thin crust I've ever had. The cooking technique gives it a very nice crispy outside but soft inside. The cheese is always fresh mozzarella and both the traditional red sauce and white garlic are great. All the ingredients are fresh and tasty and worth the money. My last visit left me wanting more sausage but that's a small discrepancy in a solid track record. At the very least give it a try and if it falls short it's all good... it's just pizza people.\n\nOh almost forgot, the Canoli are awesome! Maybe slightly overpriced for the size, but well made and decadent.	4
231	My wife and I had a great experience at Burland. Trish helped us and made it a great experience.	4
232	We went here for lunch while on vacation.  The food was great and the portions were quite large.  3 of us at for $30 plus tip.	4
233	"Truly an amazing hotel.\nWe were lucky enough to get a 1 bedroom suite overlooking The Strip and it was gorgeous.\nThe hotel staff is incredibly friendly and professional\nAs mentioned already there's no casino and no smoking in the lobby.\n\nSo I'll go over some things that are fresh in my mind.\n\nPool - pretty standard rectangular pool, gets pretty crowded on Fridays and Saturdays but we (group of 4) were always able to find something when we went down (later in the afternoon/early evening).\nThe wait staff is very pleasant for service at the pool, only qualms is that it closes at 8 pm during the summer.\n\nValet is free but they do expect tips.  Not bad if it's a once in a while thing (especially if you're driving other people and will split it)\nOtherwise there is parking across the street.\n\nThe main lobby is generally open/not crowded.  Check in on Saturday took about 10 minutes, Check out on Monday took about the same time.\n\nThe 1 bedroom suite had a incredible bedroom with an incredible bathroom.  It had a spacious dual head shower and a incredibly large jacuzzi bathtub that was able to fit 2 small/medium adults comfortably.  The different jet settings were lovely.\n\nThere are 2 free shuttles from the hotel\nOne goes to the fashion mall which is nice if you want to go there (it saves you a 5-10 minute walk, but other than that seems somewhat odd)  \nThere's also a shuttle that goes further out, but it's only once an hour and we never seemed to be heading out when it was.\n\nThe suite had a full kitchen although we didn't really bring back anything to cook.\n\nOverall the hotel is incredibly relaxing and a nice \""vacation\"" from the Strip when you want it."	3
234	Excuse me, why is my grande green tea frappe that I usually get for $4.45, over $7 here? Oh cause we're in Aria. What?! This urked me so bad but they already made it since it took forever to charge my account! Go to the one right outside of here. Ridiculous.	0
235	"Pretty fun place to check out while on the strip.  My daughter wanted to go here to meet the polar bear mascot and he didn't disappoint.  The costume is top notch and better than your standard character.  The top portion is like a puppet and is very animated.  They allow you to take your own photos, however, the background is just a green screen.  If you go upstairs, you can purchase the photos they take with an artic background added.  We bought the package which had two 5x7 photos and a sheet of four smaller sized photos for $35.    Employees are all really nice and of course the store had a great variety of Coke themed merchandise.  One of the nice \""free\"" attractions  Vegas has to offer."	3
236	I was here on valentine's day so we had the pre-fixed menu. Meal was overpriced because it was valentine's day. Nothing was really good. Maybe that's because they have to do things in bulk. The portions were small, but I didn't finish anything because it wasn't tasty.  We were still hungry afterwords. Still, we sat right by the window and the view was incredible!	2
237	I have visited La Unica many times and the experience has always been consistent... excellent food and excellent service.\n\nI am hooked on the Tacos La Unica. Two or three of these and I am happy! I have also dined on many of the specials mainly during the lunch hour and they have all been excellent.\n\nThe chips and salsa are free. The food prices are very reasonable for the quality. We have never had a bad experience.\n\nThe staff is always prompt and polite. The manager always makes an effort to stop by and say hello to us and make sure we are being taken care of and that the food is good.\n\nMy family loves to go to La Unica and asks all the time to go. \n\nNow that La Unica is on my mind, maybe I'll be the one asking to go tonight!\n\nI would give five stars if they had cervesas or margaritas, but consider this a 4.5.	3
238	The best there is. Simple as that. Period. Full Stop.	4
239	They boast that they have the worlds best pancakes - and it is true! Each bite tastes like toasted butter! Quick and friendly service, cheap, and located inside the Golden Gate Casino.	4
240	The best!	4
241	After all the reviews, decided why not give it a try?  WOW, packed on a sunday nite with a 20 minute wait.  Know all about eating the spicy mudbugs after living in houston 7 yrs.  The crawfish were really good, not soggy and mildly spiced for my tastes choosing the hot n juicy spice.  They were out of stone & blue crab, leaving only king legs and snow crab to choose from.  I got the tiny sized snow crabs, my friend got the shrimp platter.  both were mostly fries.  this place would die a quick death in south texas or the bayou country.\n\npros: food came out really fast, miller lite by the bottle served really cold.\ncons: limited items available that night, say they serve beer & wine but wine was only sold by the bottle last night.  atmosphere gets a zero, we were packed in like sardines, forgive the pun. waitress seemed frazzled, maybe it was her first night.  had to ask for lemons, WTF?	1
242	My brother and I are just visiting for two days on a road trip to CA and saw the reviews on yelp. It is a nice, pleasant breakfast atmosphere with kind servers and a cool wall mural. The food was great as well, and you definitely get your bang for your buck (a.k.a lots of food). The protein pancakes were excellent, just like the server suggested. Overall great place to wake up and eat in Scottsdale. Doesn't get a five star though because nothing really WOWED us, but it was good food.	3
243	Went here with a group of six people, with reservations for a Saturday night.  We were seated right away, but there was clearly no need for reservations as there were several empty tables.  The table next to us was having their food cooked, and nobody seemed to be excited or enjoying it.  It soon became clear why this was the case.\n  \nOur waitress came to the table once, after we sat there for about 20 minutes.  She took our order, then brought a salad for each of us after another 10 minutes.  We never saw her again until the end of the meal, when we had to ask someone for our checks.  The chef came to start cooking, and we had to ask for our soup, which had of course not been brought out by the waitress.  One couple had ordered a sushi roll, which also had not been delivered so they cancelled that.\n\nThe food was not particularly good.  The filets were all cooked to medium well, no matter how they were ordered.  On the other hand, the shrimp did not seem to be cooked all the way.  There were even items missing like a chicken breast, so the chef had to cook those at the very end. \n\nSince our waitress had not come back, we had to ask another person to refill the waters.  This person was cleaning tables and had his hand in a bucket of what was presumably bleach water.  He put that down, went to the back and started scooping ice into the pitcher without having time to wash his hands.  We did not drink the water after it was delivered.  \n\nWhen we were leaving, we told the owner about our problems with the meal and the terrible service.  She offered us $10 off for our next visit (total for six people who just spent $150) and told us not to tell anyone about the problems we experienced.  Don't worry, I won't tell.  ;-)	0
244	It's Subway...tastes the same everywhere you go...at least this place is next to my gym and they get you in and out really quick! nuff said!	1
245	I just recently stayed at the Vdara with some friends, and our experience there was 'OK'.  \n\n1) Upon driving to Vdara (if you've ever stayed there), it is a bit difficult to locate its front entrance.  Yes, it's on Harmon Avenue, but once you've figured out that you have to drive 'up' the driveway and loop around via facade of the Aria, you finally get to the 'hotel.'\n\n2) They do not have any self-parking, which is great/fine, but of course this immediately sets the expectation.  Complimentary valet should only be the beginning of the seamless experience you 'should' have.  \n\n3) The front desk attendant whom assisted us seemed to be more concerned with exposing her beauty regimen all over the front counter where her computer is situated.  This should have been the red flag to let us know that the employees of the Vdara are more concerned with their lip gloss application, versus the paying guests of the so-called 'hotel.'\n\n4) I get it, the Vdara was suppose to be a condo building, but given the mortgage crisis, they had to convert the property to a hotel.  It would have been all said and done, if they followed through with the vision.  What hotel on earth only has 1 bed in EVERY room?  With three guests, we had a Queen bed with a pull-out sofa bed.  Good luck on finding any guest who is willing to be a returning guest and sleep on a sofa conversion again.  If you're going to be a hotel, make the investment on getting some double beds into your suites.  \n\n5)  Upon entering the room, the room was clean and modern.  (Give the 'hotel' another 6 months and the beige carpet will turn into a deep brown color.  Good luck on steam cleaning those carpets on a regular basis.)  Nothing to really complain about on the room... we head out for a long joyous evening around the town.\n\n6)  Returning to the room at around 1am, we are all quite exhausted and want to call it an evening.  That's tough when the room is not stocked with any sheets or pillows for the sofa bed.  Vdara, if you're depending on your sofa beds to fully substitute a bed, make sure you have the sheets and pillows already in the room.  Who on earth wants to call and request them at 1am?  Additionally, if they already knew there would be 3 occupants, its a no brainer to already have the sheets/pillows in the room.  \n\n7)  We had then made a request for some champagne flutes and bowls to be sent to our room.  (i.e. we were out in the town during the day and wanted to return to our room to have a couple glasses of champagne with some snacks.  Thus, we called the 'hotel' to send up some flutes and bowls to our room, so that we could immediately take in the wonderful view of the hotel room.)  6 hours later, we return to our room with no champagne flutes, nor any bowls.  We called the front desk, and there was no apology for the delay.  Of course, we wait in excess of 30 min.  Unacceptable in my opinion.\n\n8)  As a no gaming hotel, no restaurant, at least keep your mini convenient store open 24hrs.  What good is it to have a kitchen in your room with a refrigerator, when you close your lobby grocery store?  (Also note, dinnerware and utensils are upon request only.)\n\n9)  I can not remember during any of my travels where a hotel secures their iron to the ironing board via bungee cord.  Your guest don't want to steal them, and if they did, just charge it on the room.  Having your irons closely secured to the ironing board is just plain stupid.\n\n10)  On one of the days we were there, we decided to go sit by the pool.  Who wants to do that if the bar is not even open?  If you're going to open the pool area, you should open the pool bar.\n\nI know, I sound like a tough one to please, but really, much of this is a no brainer in operating a '5-star hotel'.  Vdara, decide on what you want to be: a Condo building, or a Hotel?  You shouldn't advertise yourself as a hotel, but keep the service level of a Condo with HOA fees.\n\nIn all, I would have rather stayed at the decrepit Circus Circus Hotel.  At least they are not posing to be a 5 star (Orbitz rating) hotel.  I'll pass on this one.  Next time I'll stay at the Cosmopolitan.\n\nI would like to give them 1 star, but I'll rate the Vdara with 2, given the rooms were nice (for now).\n\nMy suggestion:  If you're looking to stay at a full-service hotel, don't stay at the Vdara.	1
246	Show up on Monday to place your order or Pasty's - pick up Tuesday. Very good and love the brown gravy that goes with it! Nice friendly people running this very busy establishment. We're going to try breakfast there soon.	3
247	A delicious place for breakfast! I had the trifecta which included a perfect belgian waffle, eggs, and bacon. There are a few combinations you can make. I'm a woman so I do like my options :)! Their menu is great, lots of healthy options to choose from and a lot of the egg breakfasts allows you to switch to egg whites at no additional charge!	4
248	let me start off by saying the food itself was definitely a 5. my boyfriend and I split yakitori and onigiri, and I had a pork rice bowl (very fatty but the stuff I did eat was delicious) and my boyfriend got a tuna and salmon salad special from the wall. we also got wine specials from the wall which was only 4 dollars a glass - amazing! the prices were pretty decent overall. we ate as much as we could. now for the not so great part:\n\nwe sat at the bar, it was SO HOT we lost our appetites. the service was good but know it was more of a communal effort than one server. also the food just came out randomly when it was ready not like appetizers then meals. fine with me but some people might not be cool with that. also the place was TINY. we had to wait about 2 minutes to sit, which was fine, but the line was pretty bad when we were leaving.	2
249	First time I tried.  It was awesome. But this time it is actually not good.  They also increase the price for 4th July holiday. But the food was worse. Oysters were not fresh. King crabs are small.  We were really disappointed. For almost $70 a person. Totally not worth it. Stay away for good.	1
250	This place has a lot of egg options. and I mean.. a lot. I think they had 4-5 pages worth of different types of breakfast. I was a bit.. overwhelmed.\n\nI ordered the Biscuits and Gravy with eggs and bacon. It was freakin' amazing. It's possible that I could have been hungover and anything hearty tasted good. That said, I'd still come back to try out their other options.\n\nAnyhow, there's no wait on a Monday, and the waitresses were very attentive and kind. Food arrived promptly and we were on away shortly after we scarfed down our breakfast.	4
251	I go to this part of town sometimes to visit.  We've gone several times to Chiltepin, as there's this dish called blondie or 'guera', I believe, that my sister's rave about (the name may not be advertised that way).  I tried it and it was damn tasty - loaded with lots of veggies (pico-style) and other mexican-style ingredients (meats, beans, etc).  They are good with portion sizes as I bought a burrito here that was ginormous... and the beans were yummy.\n\nThe owners are a Latin (don't know their exact background) husband and wife couple and I'm pretty sure they do all the work themselves (ie. prep, cook, serve, clean, etc) as I've never seen anyone else there.  They are very friendly and I think that friendliness/neighborliness and their food quality is the main reason my family and I still go here.  They seem to be improving from the first few months when we had tried them and their service was sssslloooow.. they are much quicker now (experience, I think) and their quality is still good.  I think they now accept card, but I usually pay cash to small businesses...\n\nI would suggest they keep their menu limited and not so vast.. especially for a new start-up, you want to make sure you can deliver what you say in a timely manner and not waste product.. if you have a surprlus of product because your menu is vast, you are wasting and not meeting your cycle time for customer service... \n\nOut of all the shady taco/burrito/tostada places on Central in SoPho, I choose this one to go to because of the owners and operators.	3
252	Had a flat tire this morning. And was literally freaking out. I could see a huge screw in the side of my tire ): unfortunately they could not repair it however they removed my bad tire and put my spare on for free and then drove my car to my work for me. I work within walking distance and was able to leave  my car there and they brought it to me. AWSOME SERVICE!!!! I was almost in tears when I got there as I just started a new job and did not want to be  and they totally turned my day around! I will recommend these guys to everyone.	4
253	Eek - If you are considering getting married here I would bring in your own Wedding Planner who is a Professional ! The lady running this is extremely rude and does not work well with families or vendors !   USually when you are a planner at a venue you solve problems and dont just shrug you shoulders and ay oh well ! -	0
254	I must be missing something here! What's all the fuss about? Is there a certain pizza I should be ordering?  I wanted to like this spot, but left a little disappointed.\n \nOrdering by the slice is something I am used to at food courts inside of every mall in America. The difference is that the slices here are no joke!  One slice is enough to feed just about any person with a healthy appetite. \n\nI opted for a slice of pepperoni and sausage. Ok--here are the positives.....\nThe tomato sauce they use is light, flavorful, and what I have come to expect out of a good pizzeria. The dough is a good consistency and holds up without tearing or getting mushy.\n\nWhat I didn't care for was the toppings they used. The pepperoni seemed cheap and greasy.   In other words, the kind of pepperoni you would find on pizza in the freezer section of your favorite grocery store. The sausage was fresh but lacked flavor. I ended up wishing I ordered a slice of cheese instead.\n\nI will give this place another try, so I can sample the desserts that everyone talks about. The place is small and serves as a better take out place at the moment. However, it seems as though they may be renovating since the last time I was there. \n\nI am really searching for that can't miss pizza place in Las Vegas. I have been trying for 6 years and have not been successful.  Maybe next time, it will be better. Let's hope so!	2
255	The rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either.  I will say that the bar had good drinks and a good atmosphere.  \n\nThe biggest thing that I hate about the hotel is the valet service.  They were rude and on both the occasions that I walked up to them by myself, they would not flag me a cab nor offer limo service.  Even when I asked they would not do it.  I ended up waving to one of the limo guys myself to get a ride.  Only the one time, when I came out with one of my co-workers did they offer to bring over one of the cabs.  I was there on business and we had an event at the hotel.  There were many cabs and limos around the hotel.  Next time I definitely stay at the Marriott down the street.   This hotel gives you the type of service you would get at crap hotel but with a much higher price.	0
256	3 stars for our server, James, keeping our drinks full and the quick service provided over all. That's it. \n\nI used to eat here pretty frequently about 5 years ago and the food was always really delicious, that I remember anyway. \n\nSeems their menu has shrunk considerably and so has the quality of food. I got the chicken fried steak which was good but totally overloaded with breading, and it was almost as if they fried it to long or it started to get to that point because the edges of the meat and the breading were fried hard. Eww.  My Cesar salad looked really sad with wilted lettuce. My hash browns were over fried and my eggs were wet slimy like. Bleh! My cousin had the fried chicken which she said was good but her steamed veggies were still hard, complete with dried out carrots and a cold baked potato. \n\nThe only reason I would come back here is prob if I was severely intoxicated and it was the last place on earth to eat something to help soak up the cohol. We had more fun building a mountain out of food we didn't eat. We felt the food was put to better use and looked nicer that way :)	2
257	New to Vegas we heard this was the Best Mexican food in town, we were very disappointed. Atmosphere Excellent, Service Excellent Food....horrible.\nMy parents were in town and wanted to hear some Mariachi's so this is why we went.\n\nWe will never go back. Talking to other locals it may just be this location. So if you are doing to try them don't go here!	0
258	Dinner was pretty bad. Add slow service and it worsened the experience. Breakfast was much better. Stay away from the day old 1/2 frozen baked goods.	1
259	I have been to this post office many times in the past, the people who work behind the counter are usually very nice and I appreciate them...\n\nHOWEVER today there was a line so I used the self service computer to mail a package. I paid $12.+ for 2 days but it said it would be delivered on Thursday, today is Monday...that is not 2 days. There was a man working there with short dark brown hair and mustache and beard and wore glasses. Wearing plain clothes and a name badge that was turn around but I believe it said Don. When I asked him WHY 2 days is 4 days I got a totally condescending attitude that everything is going ground and that the package could be delivered in 8 days because there are no flights and that that is just how it is and there are no refunds so I can file a complaint but that is how it is.  SERIOUSLY? USPS is having financial difficulty and this is your customer service. I felt like I just got screwed at the casino and just made a $12+ donation to USPS! I grabbed my  package and spent $23 at Fedex to ensure delivery. USPS just lost a customer!	1
260	I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about. If you don't want to spend $9 for 'Asian' food next door from Genghis grill and you're near the movie theatre come here. This is actually a relaxing break from Panda Express. I cringe every time I think of Panda Express.\n\nThis is a review about Yum Yum, don't get me wrong, but let me tell you why you should come here instead of Panda. Practically everything at Panda is dipped in some cornstarch concoction and fried. That leaves for a large volume of your meat being starch. This place is awesome, because they don't do that crap. The mongolian beef is all beef and plenty of vegetables. The mandarin chicken is less fatty than Panda, at Panda the chicken is fairly fatty. Anyways, I like this place a lot for the reasons I've already listed. The taste doesn't overwhelm you like it does at Panda. Yeah, Panda is good the first three times you try it, after that its rather bland and maybe even gross. \n\nService here was excellent. Came in, got a smile, got my food, they were willing to do half chow mein, half rice. Awesome. Pricing is good, thus, value is good. Its a little too Pandy Express ish, everything looks like Panda, it tastes better though. If they could get a little creative and invdividual, they'd be 5 stars.	3
261	Pros: pulled pork, barbeque sauce, wood chips, service (Dave was great), paper table covers, sauteed veggies, sweet potato fries\n\nCons (all were only minorly disappointing): watery lemonade, dry cornbread, no baked beans, sandwich buns, mac and cheese okay. \n\nOverall, would recommend. Not quite as good as billed	2
262	This place truly exceed your expectations.  Dont judge the food from the outside! The food is so good and worth every penny you spend! Just try it! You wont regret this decision!	4
263	Even with a 20% off coupon from Caesars this place is a joke!\nAn over hyped 7/11 style self serve slushy with barely any alcohol. Supposedly I paid extra for 2 patron shots but I never saw patron bottles anywhere. The tequila was brought out from the back in vials. Can you say scam? I never even got a buzz...on an empty stomach.\nSave your $20 on your 18oz slur pie & go to the liquor stores on the strip.	0
264	Biscuit and Gravy not very good.	0
265	"Not so much a liberal approach to reporting as a brainless attempt to convey \""news,\"" New Times has continued to disappoint and frustrate me on a weekly basis. So, why do I subject myself to the pain of this paper? Usually, only two things [garnering it the two stars]: Savage Love and the Night&Day. The former keeps me informed (and sometimes offers new ideas to keep that spark going ;) ) while the latter gives me something to plan on doing over the weekend. Honestly, it was N&D that turned me on to Cazwell. Some times the restaurant and movie reviews aren't painful. Otherwise, there is no worthwhile content in this paper. That, and I feel I've been duped by their fabricated stories a few too many times and you're wasting your time; you're not The Onion and are wasting our time if you think you are.\n\nWhile I consider myself left-of-center, New Times just dives off the deep end without its inflatable floatation devices. I'm not member of Sheriff Joe's fan club, but I don't view him as a serpentine demon. And while I admitted up front that the sex column piques my interest, the avalanche of provocative advertising is too much at times. I don't want to think my sushi has been in contact with a naked person, thank you very much.\n\nWhen we buy a house that has a little more property and I can start my garden, New Times will be part of that process. It will do wonders to keep the weeds at bay."	1
266	"what is it with my luck paying money for services that fail to fix my problem? I went in to Big O Tires after seeing an advertisement on their window for an A/C check. After driving around 2 wks in a hot as hell car I said enough is enough and gave them a call to diagnose the problem. I was told that I was almost a pound low on freon and sent on my way. Yay! Cheapest option, right? Wrong. So very very wrong. Unfortunately I dropped by an hour before closing so I'm guessing I was rushed out while they were closing shop. They either never checked the air coming out of my vents for themselves or they KNEW they were ripping me off $150. As I pulled into my driveway 15 minutes later my car was no cooler at all.\n\nNext day I book it there to see what they could do since I just dropped some cash there. \""Come in Saturday and my A/C guy will take a look.\"" Fine.\n\nCome Saturday I'm praying for a leak somewhere. Hey! I paid $15 for flourescent dye! It better prove useful. 30 minutes later and I'm told it is low. \""So it leaked since Monday?\"" I asked. \""Monday?\"" \""Yes. I brought it in Monday and paid for an evac and recharge.\"" He had no idea. Smell something fishy yet? So he takes it back again and looks it over finally coming back to say he was wrong about it being low (REEEEEAAALLY FISHY) and it is either one of two parts. I was referred to a shop for them to check as they couldn't do it there but they couldn't refund me for the evac and recharge. However I could have this shop do the repairs and Big O wouldn't charge for the second evac and recharge that would have to be done on my car. First off... nobody would let someone leave their shop after doing work only to have someone else finish the job. WTF.\n\nSo here I am now spending a grand for a new A/C today when $29.95 was supposed to diagnose this a week ago.\n\nIf you are feeling charitable, at least pick a more honest organization to throw your hard earned money at. Now if you excuse me, I have a district manager to write."	0
267	I am a regular here and have an unlimited card which is \u00a314.99 on direct debit a month.\nIt is a really good saving and if you go twice a month then you are up on the deal. I have seen me being here 5- 6 times a month so it definitely works for me. \n\nThe food is pricey so I tend not to buy any and also the food counter staff are not the quickest and I have waited over 20 minutes previously to be served ice cream, which is a long time if your film is due to start.\n\nFree parking for up to 4 hours\n\nGood location not to far from my house & town\n\nIf your a movie buff like me, it is worth signing up.	3
268	I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone when I read reviews about this or the neighboring PF Changs. It's literally only about atmosphere and the drinks. The food is beyond bland in my opinion for the price. I've tried the various meatless enchiladas, bean burrito and vegetable fajitas - the fajitas were OK but everything else was incredibly bland( I don't even know how you can make a cheese enchilada bland but somehow it is.)  So again - Atmosphere, Service and Drinks is what this place is all about.	1
269	Being a fan of the $2.99 crispy chicken deluxe, which comes out to $3.87 when I upsize to medium, I made it a lunch stop. It served its purpose by filling me up at an inexpensive price.\n   On my visit here, the service was fine. The restaurant was also clean.	3
270	Simply Awesome.  I first went there when they opened in Sun Prairie.  I loved it, but I didn't think they would last simply because almost nothing does.  A few years later they are here and going strong.  I have had just about everything on the menu and I have never once been disappointed.  Especially with the dolmades.  I'm a sucker for dolmades.\n\nIf you want a light atmosphere in a cozy restaurant and the finest Greek food in Southern Wisconsin, go to Atlantis Taverna.  We go every couple of weeks, and when a kitchen experiment fails, it's off to Atlantis for some food.\n\nDo yourself a favor and stop in, try a sampler plate or a gyro, or the spanikopita. Anything.  Your tastebuds will love you for it.	4
271	"This used to be my favorite Gamestop when Dijon worked here, but he's since moved to the blue diamond location, so I frequent that one more, although this one is still closest and I like it. Sacha has been working at this location for a while too, and he's cool, but I dealt with Dijon a lot more and he knew me as a regular and always hooked up free shwag.\nIf you're used to buying videogames, then you may know how a store like this works, however, some people are still noobs, so I'm here to help.  \nLet me start with a list of things to do and things not to do at this franchise.\n\nDO:\nNumber 1 - Pre-orders:\nPre-order the AAA titles that have collector's editions or special editions, or limited produced items like arcade fightsticks.  Wal-mart and best buy usually won't have these items and gamestop will only order as many as they are reserved, so if you don't, you're fucked, and you're going to be hitting up ebay and paying double or triple the retail value in some cases.\nPre-order the hot titles and if you change your mind come release day, just back out and get your money back. You don't HAVE to buy the game if you change your mind, and nobody is forcing you to.  It's just like having a little bit of security and not getting screwed when the game gets sold out elsewhere.  As incentive,  there's always exclusive pre-order bonuses for in-game content, and they call to remind you when the game will be out a couple days before...so why not.\n\nNumber 2 - \""Free Rentals\"":\nSome people might not be aware of this loop-hole, but if you buy a USED game, you have 7 days to return it for a full refund, granted you kept the receipt.  This is mostly for the Achievement and Trophy whores who know that they'll beat a certain game in a week and want nothing to do with it again after that...whores like me.  This is also convenient if you're considering buying a game, but are not sure if you'll like it, or if you think you might get bored of it after a while.  I use the term \""free\"" loosely, because you do have to front the money, but you get it back in the end.  \nTry it out at least once.\n\nDON'T:\nNumber 1 - Trade Ins:\nI've heard it a million times, pissed off gamers who think Gamestop is so evil because they give you pennies on the dollar for your used games, then turn around and sell it at retail price.  This is true...they do that.  But if they're going to sell a game at retail, why shouldn't you get retail price for it?  \nFor this, I suggest ebay for getting the right amount of cash back for your games you don't want anymore.  Here, you can undersell Gamestop, but still get back more what they would offer you.  Play the money game; instead of giving them nothing but profit by buying their used games, use the \""free rentals\"" loop-hole.  Instead of getting ripped off by them on trade-ins, undersell them on ebay. \n\nNumber 2 - Midnight Releases:\nI would highly advise to never go to a midnight release...at any location. For reals...they're always shitty and you'll have a fucked up time because it's just not that much of an organized event if you're strictly going there with intent to buy the game at midnight.  It's chaotic.  D-bags cut in line in front of those who have been waiting hours, the kids are annoying, and there is no structure at the registers.\nI mean, I guess if you plan on not getting home until 1 - 2am, downing RedBull, and staying up all night with your new game, then go for it.\nI, however, prefer to save the headache, go to bed instead, and come back in the morning where the game will be waiting.   I'm too old for that midnight shit anyway.  It's just not cool to me.\n\nAll in all, Gamestop is the juggernaut of commercial game sales, and their stores are popping up more than McDonald's and Starbucks, which is a good thing.\nI've spent more money on new games than I can remember at these stores because I'm an avid collector, and they cater to my needs.  Occasionally, I'll buy used if it's a game I never picked up on launch day, and it's been marked down decently and it's in pristine shape, and if I think I'll keep it for more than a week, haha.\n\nGamestop is legit."	3
272	Very friendly service, love that this place is locally owned! They will text you when your prescription is ready. Overall I've had great experiences here.	4
273	After one of the people from this store walked around our furniture showroom and passed out her business cards to my clients, I DEFINITELY will not be shopping here. That was low. Not sure why this posted 18 days ago, this happened about a year ago.	0
274	Their sweet tea is the best in Charlotte, they use Royal Cup and you can taste the difference.  \n\nThe pancakes are definitely their high point.  they are the perfect combination of golden, soft and spongey.  Their omelettes are massive and fully of cheesy yummy goodness.  I ordered an egg and bacon plate and there was more crispy bacon than eggs (which is never a bad thing!)\n\nMake absolute sure you get there early or else there is a huge line, before 9 is better.	4
275	Ordered delivery from this location today- large pepperoni pizza. The pizza arrived in a timely manner (about 45 minutes). The crust was nice and chewy, but lacked flavor. They were generous with the cheese. Overall, the pizza I received was average (not bad, but not great). As someone who is new to the area, I will likely try other pizza places in the future.	2
276	"How lazy can you get? I made reservations on the Yelp app on OpenTable and it is a stones throw from our hotel room. I told my husband to choose somewhere to eat for his belated birthday and he chose Fiamma. \n\nI love the decor. I love chic places. It was also nice to see a little reception dinner for a newly married couple. I've always contemplated a Vegas wedding. The tab would be under a grand. Nice! Anyway, dinner was awesome. The hostess brought us to our table pretty quickly and they even accommodated us when we wanted to move to a booth. The server jokingly said \""no PDA but under the table stuff is fine\"". It was really romantic. A nice getaway from Christmas craziness. We ordered cocktails. The hubs had the Fiamma \""The Original\"" and I had the Pineapple Upside Down Cake. The drinks were pretty tasty. Order the Caprese to share. When I order Caprese I don't expect much but some buffalo mozzarella and sliced tomatoes. When the salad came out it was colorful. Chopped up yellow and red tomatoes, strips of basil, and soft buffalo mozzarella and some awesome tasty green sauce. I ordered the Raviolini which is amazing shortrib ravioli with black truffle goodness. It was super good as the pasta was al dente. My husband ordered the Orecchiette. Both of our entrees were good tasting and totally worth it. Prior to dinner we told the server where we were from and that we were celebrating my husband's birthday (even it was a week before). We ordered the Crocchette for dessert which were little donuts made of Amaretto and Ricotta and dipping sauce. The server was so nice he brought us out glasses of champagne and even made a little Happy Birthday display with a candle for my hubs.\n\nThe service was top notch and our server was super personable. He was really attentive to us even when the restaurant was close to closing. Overall experience was fabulous. If you have a hard time deciding on the millions of restaurants to eat at in Vegas and feel like Italian, come to MGM and try it out. Pricey but totally worth the food quality, ambiance, and service."	4
277	WORST hotel ever. Seriously. I only stayed here because the mega, mega IBS tradeshow was next door at the convention center. I won't make the same mistake next year. I do have to say that the front desk was amazing, helpful and friendly. But overall the hotel was a wreck. My sink was stopped up and they could never get it right. The towels looked dirty and dingy. It was just a complete disaster. Next year I would rather stay farther away from the convention center and have a high quality hotel. They should just implode this place and start over!	0
278	You can always count on the British Open Pub as a great place to watch a sports game--you'll always have a TV available.\n\nMaybe it's because it's sandwiched in the Papago Plaza is not always the most happenin' place.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you shouldn't give this spot a try. It's golf-themed, which is refreshing in a sea of Irish- and football-themed bars, and it has a large menu of both food and drinks. There are also daily specials in the kitchen.\n\nFor my meal, I got a house salad ($5.95) and macaroni and cheese ($3.95), which tasted just fine-nothing phenomenal, but they were pretty good as bar food.\n\nMy pal got the English Style Fish and Chips ($10.95), which came with peas-something I'm not used to seeing on many plates these days (thank gosh, because I hate them), but I guess they made the meal more authentically British.\n\nAnd even though the bar wasn't crowded, the people who were there seemed to be really into watching the game that was on. It's also a family-friendly place, so there were a couple of families in addition to the 20-somethings-which included a big group who brought balloon noisemakers. The spot was proof that your experience is what you make of it, and thankfully for us, it was spirited but not uncomfortably cramped like some of the other places we visited.	2
279	Ate twice at Mozen Bistro for breakfast while staying at the Mandarin. Unfortunately, I am forced to give this place a 1 star rating.\n\nAfter waiting what seemed like an eternity to be served (greater than 45 minutes), I found a LONG black hair entwined in my Huevos Rancheros. It was beyond disgusting! I have no idea how they didn't see it in there. The eggs were literally stuck to and hanging off the hair when I lifted my fork. \n\nI was absolutely starving and was nearly about to cry at the sight of the hair. When I reported it to our waiter, he apologized and took the plate. While they were preparing a new order, I had to pick off of everyone else's plate because I was so hungry. I grudgingly ate the newly prepared huevos, and only because I was still hungry... otherwise I would have bailed on the whole situation.\n\nThis definitely isn't the first hair that I've found in food, but it's pretty disturbing when you find one at a place that charges $12 for a bowl of Cheerios. Mozen is expensive and exclusive. It should be held to a higher standard than iHop when it comes to quality control. \n\nWhy the 1 star? \n\n* Hair in food. Probably enough said.\n* For an insanely overpriced restaurant in an exclusive hotel, I felt that the hair warranted an apology from the restaurant manager or someone in charge. When you make a mistake of this magnitude, it deserves a sincere apology.\n* They only comped my huevos rancheros on the bill. I felt that was kind of chintzy.\n\nWhat could have earned a 3 star?\n\n* An apology from management\n* A more generous compensation than just simply replacing the hair-laden dish with a new one and not charging for it. I probably think the whole bill should have been comped since it was only breakfast and not like a $400 dinner bill. And I was a guest at the hotel.	0
280	"Not for everyone. Although I think kids would have a decent time here, for 2 adults looking for something to do, Rawhide doesn't have much to offer. We paid $5 for parking and spent about 30 minutes walking through the \""town\"" and took a few pictures. But we really could have gone without. I wouldn't recommend putting this on your to do list for the area but if you're really into the western theme, I suppose you'll find town interesting."	1
281	These guys have never been less than stellar in the service they provide.  I have used them for years as a homeowner as well as CEO of medium-sized Human Services agency in the Chandler area.  These folks will help you with what you need, research options for you, allow you to return batteries without question, are very knowledgeable, and best of all, really not afraid to take a risk by trusting their customers.  I highly recommend them	4
282	Currently it is raining. Everytime it does rain I lose the connection. I pay over a 100.00 for this service and it really does not deliver. I am  going to obtain a digital antenae. I can't believe they actually charge people for this poor service. A set of rabbit ears with aluminum foil would work better than this piece of crap.\nDo not consider buying this....\n\n\n'b	0
283	Quite frankly, I think i was Hispanic during my past life or something because I absolutely loveeeeee Mexican food! Now you cant really find authentic Mexican food around this area but this place is pretty legit.   definitely recommend the steak tacos and brisket nachos!! Yum!	4
284	Gelato trip right before seeing Le Reve.\nCashier looked as if she had better things to do. She didn't really engage us but mostly just stood there and stared at us. We got a few samples to narrow down our choices and placed our order.\n\nI had the Carmel crunch gelato in a waffle cone.  Aside of the cashier the gelato was good. You could probably find better gelato with more flavors elsewhere, and even someone with a better attitude as well. \n\nCheck it out if you're in the area of the Wynn, but it does not require a special out of your way trip.	2
285	Usually I get just average service. Once, i saw  The hostess wearing sweats and a hoodie. She looked tired and left her post for a good 4-5 minutes.  Not presentable at all. . But i went with my boyfriend last month and we received the most unprofessional service in our whole restaurant eating career. Our waitress was talking bad behind my boyfriend's back while he was in the bathroom. Not only that but she rushed him while he was deciding what to eat. We understand it's busy and it may be stressful, but you are still the waitress and you are still supposed to be providing a service. There are no excuses. We were kind enough not to complain to the manager, but we did not tip. Would not go there AGAIN.	0
286	Place is great to look at and part of a creative revival of several older downtown Phoenix buildings turned eateries/bars. \n\nCrowd was a mixed type but leaned towards upwardly mobile hipsters? Some decent craft beers on tap, some wine offered as well. Really great cocktails.\n\nMenu is fairly vast and diverse, I settled on the pretzels (delish with creamy cheese sauce) and the fried chicken (not so great). \n\nServers and helpers were beyond friendly yet completely disorganized this night, but I was in a good mood and opted not to make their lives miserable. Plus they acknowledged every error and forgetful act and we received a majority of the meal for nothing. Big props for that. \n\nOverall I'll be back. Love the environment and cool folks, but the jury is still out on the food overall for me.	2
287	"Britney: Piece of Crap\n\nThis was a terrible show.  Britney was bored and barely moved.  I will never get that time back that I wasted at her \""show\"".  Save your money, go to a different show. Or just sit outside at Cabo Wabo and people watch, it's MUCH more entertaining!!!!"	0
288	Got a cotton candy sorbet on top of vanilla custard with sprinkles. It was absolutely delish and not overly sweet. The custard was so nice and thick that I was afraid the plastic spoon they gave me would snap. The servers could be a little friendlier and less monotonous. They were helpful but gave me the impression that they just didn't want to be there. The store gives the ambience of a darker Baskin Robbins. For a nicer experience, my advice is to get your stuff to go and eat it at the nearby park.	2
289	This club is amazing to look at.... I love what they did with the decor, I feel like this is what a Vegas club should look like (take some notes Prive and The Bank!).  \n\nWe were able to get in minus the lines and the craziness, thank goodness, and in the beginning it was a little too much for me....I like the bar at the entrance but the main room was CRAZY crowded, but I'm sure most places worth visiting in Vegas would be on a Friday.  \n\nAfter being pushed up against the Buddhist statue one too many times, we went out to Tao Beach.  I did return after a few hours and it had cleared out quite a bit and was really nice.  I was super drunk by this time, but I had a great time at Tao.  Good music and less skanky people than a couple of the other places I experienced on my trip to Vegas.	3
290	This place is slow	0
291	I like the #5..	3
292	"Let me explain the 3 stars.  I give LoveSac 5 stars for their product. Love love love it.  We have their Sactional series and think it is the greatest thing, great quality, fun to configure, soft, comfy.  So definitely you can not go wrong with the product.  \n\nHowever, good luck dealing with the staff.   Every single time we have bought something, it is like having all of our teeth pulled.  It feels like they have no idea what they are doing.  Luckily, we have gritted our teeth and stood our ground, and everything has worked out each time.  \n\nBut on a recent visit, we were one of at least three customers in the store with complaints and problems in a 10-minute period.  Shouldn't they realize that if so many people are complaining, they should do something about their customer service?  Plus give more respect to repeat customers?  Order online instead to get the great product and have more control over your transaction!\n\nUPDATE:  I want to say that  \""Roy\"" has definitely come through for us this time and impressed us with his initiative; go Roy!  But this weird service issue has been ongoing since 2010.  So like I said, it usually works out, and there is at least one conscientious staffer, but in general the service is frustrating."	2
293	THE place to go on Madison's North Side.  Roomy, beautiful decor, family-operated, friendly staff.  The pastries are good, the bread and rolls are excellent, and the brunch and lunch menus are amazing!  There are lots of good vegetarian options, all clearly marked.  The Earthly Delights sandwich is my favorite--wow.  The soups and salads are also very, very good.\n\nMy only complaint is Manna's coffee, which is sometimes thin and over-extracted.  People who don't have a taste for good espresso may not mind (my Mom likes it fine), but I have to order a mocha or flavor syrup to cover up the bitter taste, and the texture of the mocha simply does not compare to what you'll get at the cafes on the square.  Still, it's probably the best coffee on the North Side.	4
294	"If you're a work from homer, then sometimes you just need to get out of your crib and find a quiet spot to be all kinds of productive. Sometimes this \""productive place\"" outside the home is a local coffee shop, a cafe or even (gasp) a library. Yes, folks, a library. Where it's supposed to be all sorts of quiet and somber. I decided to pack up my laptop and bring her to the Myers Park library branch yesterday to focus and be productive outside of my house.\n\nHere's the thing about the major changes with the Char/Meck library systems as of late, because of the budget squeezes, funding cuts and closings around the county, the libraries are really full at really odd times. Like a Tuesday afternoon. I figured this out yesterday as I tried to grab a cubby and get some work done. No such luck. No open tables, either. And really though, I can't blame them. This particular branch is pretty small and doesn't have a ton of \""working\"" space. Plus, because many of the other (larger) branches are closed on Tuesdays, the Myers Park branch gets a ton of their overflow. \n\nThus, the library was chock full of kids, Internet surfers and folks coming in and out to use their services. I take no issue with the crowded factor, as this branch is clearly serving its community and its needs. Yay for that! Just keep it in mind that this may not be as quiet as you think!\n\nThe folks who work here are very, very sweet and helpful. Not only did they help me find a few books for an upcoming beach trip, but I also overhead them helping anyone and everyone with a question or issue. As previously mentioned, there is a bank of individual cubbies for the working bees and a few tables near the back if you're lucky enough to score one. Literature wise, this is a small branch. But I highly recommend searching for your books online and you can request that the be put on hold at whichever branch you like. Thus, whichever library that has said book(s) will send them over to the Myers Park branch (or whichever branch you designate online) and they will notify you when they are ready to be picked up. Stroll on over to the branch, pick up your books, hit up the self-checkout and poof! Instant literature bliss.\n\nA few other things to note about this particular location: the parking is easy but can be tight when they are busy. They offer free WiFi and have a small, but diverse, selection of magazines and media at your disposal. Here's hoping that the county figures it out and supports our library structure as a whole. They should be open every day, folks."	2
295	I ordered delivery because of the good reviews. I ordered garlic knots and a hawaiian pizza. When the food arrived, the garlic knots were stale and crunchy. I could not eat them. The pizza wasn't much better. The cheese was already rubberized andbthe grease soaked through to the bottom leaving a floppy, soggy crust. I wouldn't recommend eating this to anyone. It was one of those times that trying something new over the usual was a disaster.	0
296	This review is for the minute clinic-\nDo not come here!! Go somewhere, anywhere else.\nI caught the flu so I checked online to see there was no wait time at this location. Checked in and the computer said it would be a 10-15 minute wait. No problem... Well after 30 minutes, some lady calls me up front to tell me they cant see me because they close at 5:30 and the doctor will not stay past closing. So frustrating. I ended up going to UMC instead.	0
297	"I have given this place a try quite a few times during the past few years. I was just here as last resort because the other places in the area were closed on Sundays. It's not that I expect friendly service from the person working at the counter but when your place is named \""Aloha\"" Kitchen, you'd think someone can crack a smile and say hi when they take your order.  It's just not one time, it's consistently like this, no greeting at all!   \n\nThe food is alright, I do give credit that they plate the food attractively, but they rely too much on drowning their meats in sauce for flavor instead of seasoning and marinating it.  The slices of beef that did have no sauce were a little dry & tasteless.  The manapua I ordered was a store bought brand and the dough was a bit tough. (like they left it cooking in the microwave a little too long) . That's probably why you get your food real quick!! It's already been prepared all they do is reheat it!  There are at least 3 other places that serve up better Hawaiian & Filipino food in the area so aloha, Aloha Kitchen."	1
298	"Bought a Groupon for 3 months of membership and in the \""how to\"" section it requires us to call (702)818-5800 to register. After numerous attempts during their \""staffed\"" hours at 10am-6pm to register, they finally leave a voicemail for my friend and lets us know that we can come in anytime 10am-6pm to register. We have to register to get the key so we can have 24 hour access to their facility.\n\nToday me and my friend go to anytime at 2:15PM and try to open the door for the guest entrance. Surprise surprise it is locked. There are people in the gym of course, the other customers who already have a key to access the member access entrance. Where is the staff? There is no sign that says \""out for lunch\"". Don't call it staffed hours if there is no staff working. Called a handful of times while waiting outside and no one answers. Bigger waste of time than trying to order a steak at a vegan restaurant. \n\nDefinitely not the best business people. Will update when the \""staff\"" contacts us back."	0
299	As others have said it is a nice bowling alley.  We came around 5 on a Friday evening and the wait was an hour so that was a bummer.  We decided to wait and played in the arcade and it had nice equipment but was outrageously expensive.  If you don't mind spending a little money it isn't a bad place, but maybe next time we'll try stopping by at a less busy time.	2
300	"First I'd like to say that I love reading the reviews where dudes say \""there just aren't enough options for free weights for me\"" or \""can't do heavy lifting here\"". Lol. I challenge them to use the maximum weight of any dumbbells or machines in this gym. If you need more than 75 lb dumbbells, you. are. buffffffffff. and you should probably just start bench pressing cars or something in order to get a good workout.\n\nOk, so I went with this gym because of the price...$29 to start, $10/mo then up to $15/mo after a year. No contract, just $25 to cxl. I have since seen lots of Groupons and deals for it and that kiiiiiiiiiiind of pisses me off every time I see it. The prices are SIGNIFICANTLY lower on those sites and I wish I would've been able to take advantage of that when I joined. You can also do the higher level membership for something like $20/mo and get guest privileges and half price on products like drinks that you can buy. For me...I'd rather bring my own water anyway and since I don't bring anyone with me I don't need the guest privileges. But...it's an option.\n\nI like the cardio equipment, treadmills and arc trainers (kiiiiiind of like an elliptical but with more of a stair climber motion than elliptical has). They all have TVs built in with basic cable to distract you from your boring cardio. Haha. They also have iPod capability where you plug in using their plug (which charges your iPod while you use it) and you can listen to it through the machine using the buttons on the machine to skip, play, control volume, etc...\n\nBecause the equipment is new, I haven't experienced many broken machines like I have at older gyms. I have reported equipment that was malfunctioning in various ways and the employees are always prompt about testing them, putting \""out of order\"" signs on them, and I have never seen something broken for more than a day or two.\n\nThey do have some equipment like medicine balls, kettle weights, and the big inflatable exercise balls. I don't personally use these things, but they ARE available and some people dig them.\n\nThere are no classes or pool, which I never used at other gyms anyway so I'm glad not to have to pay to not use them.\n\nThe employees are...cool for the most part. Most of them are friendly and willing to help you figure out a machine or exercise, spot you, or answer questions about workouts. There are a few rude ones, but I won't be too specific about those for fear that they will read this. Hey, I have to keep going here! :P \n\nThe gym is constantly being cleaned by the employees...vacuuming, wiping things down with spray, and checking and lubing up cables are things that seem to constantly be going on here. I like this a lot. There are also cleaning stations where you can grab your own spray and paper towels to wipe things down if  you wish. They offer hand sanitizer as well, which is nice at a place like a gym where everyone is touching everything.\n\nAs I read as a complaint in another post, they DO ask that you bring a towel. I too think this is a little annoying because I'm not one of those people who sweat all over the damn place, BUT...I get why it's a policy. There are some sweaty ass people at the gym and there's nothing worse than getting on a treadmill with nasty sweat droplets all over it or trying to sit on a weight bench that has someone's ass crack sweat on it. Gross. Just bring the towel people. There's no rule about the towel...it can be a little 2x2 square if you want to be a smart ass, or a beach towel if you like to maybe wear a towel cape while working out.\n\nI've heard of a couple people getting double charged for their memberships, but staff is pretty quick to resolve these issues.\n\nOverall, this is a good gym. It certainly offers enough for anyone to get a decent workout. I guess if you're a professional body builder who needs 1,000 lb machines and 200 lb dumbbells, it's not good enough, but for NORMAL people it's sufficient."	3
301	I've eaten in twice, eaten take-out here several times.  The food I can't fault.  It's tasty, even taking it home, and I don't think any fish camp could match it.  Seriously, if you want take out fish, this IS the place, bar none.  \n\nThe reason it loses two stars is the seating inside the restaurant.  One time we went we were put in a smaller dining room and the experience was very pleasant.  Enough room between tables and we could hear each other from across the table.  The other time we ate in the main dining room and HOLY CARP!  You can't hear yourself think!  The tables are stacked one on top of the other, and it makes you think that every person in Fort Mill is hearing impaired, because there's a LOT of shouting and hideously loud talking in that room!  I had such a headache when I left the actual enjoyment of the food had been long lost.  I think I'll stick to take out from now on and save on the Advil!  I've been in crowded fish camps before and NONE of them were as intolerable as the main dining room at Captain Steve's!	2
302	I'm in turmoil on who I should rate this place. The decor and atmosphere is two stars. It smelled disgusting when we walked in, like sulfur or rotten eggs. Then the decor is like 1980's, with the white chairs. Oy - then there's the service. I'm gluten-free, and I had some trouble getting that across. She said that all of the soy protein has wheat in it, so she recommended the tofu dishes. I ended up getting the tofu dish with rice noodles and vegetables. I have no idea if there was wheat in the sauce, but at that point in the meal, I really didn't care. I just wanted to order and get the experience over with. \n\nThe food came out pretty quickly though. My friend got the spicy cha cha (that looks like shrimp but is actually yam) and it was SUPER spicy and I think it tasted like Long John Silver's fried shrimp basket. BUT she really liked it. My dish was pretty okay, although a little bland. The veggies weren't really great either, but for a vegan dish that's less than $10, I guess it was okay.\n\nI had planned on getting dessert, but we were given the check even before she asked if we wanted dessert. After I made some statement about it she asked if we wanted any, and told us they only had two out of the four desserts on the menu anyways. We went without it.\n\nAnd yes, they do have the TV running strange vegan propaganda. Very strange, and I don't really want to look at baby pigs while I dine, but it could have been weirder. I guess. \n\nSO - for the price, I guess it is decent vegan cuisine. I guess I wouldn't really know seeing as how I LOVE MEAT, but hey, I'm up for trying everything once. I think if the atmosphere and service was better I would have actually liked the dining experience and the food more. If it was better inside, I'd be tempted to go to this place again. Eventually, I'd like to try the dessert. If they offer it to me.	2
303	I love this store. The customer service is on point and there is a feeling of friendship around everyone there. I remember my second time going into this store one of the guys who worked there remembered me and said it was nice to see me, my awkward personality didn't know how to respond but I was happy he remembered me. I wish I would of said thanks or something other than nothing. These guys rock. Also there's a try before you buy cabinet which is awesome. Keep it up guys.	4
304	Great food and it won't put a hole in your wallet.  I love the Spicy Beef Vermicello soup and the rice crepes, and the avocado shakes.  I can eat here everyday.	4
305	As a consumer of electronics, I like this place. I was in a lack-luster relationship with Best Buy and we were only in it until something better came along. Fry's is my something better. They really do have everything:TV, video, audio, car stereos, computers, appliances, gaming, magazines, toys...and a cafe in the middle-not that that was the deal breaker. \nThey always seem to have specials on DVDs which I think is cool but be careful-that $25 you were planning on spending can easily turn into $200. This really is a one-stop shop for the geek in all of us.	3
306	I really enjoyed this restaurant.\nIt came as somewhat of a surprise, since the hotel room service food was of mediocre at best quality. \nOur server was super attentive and friendly. The sunset over the golf course was divine.\nThe atmosphere was very nice. Not too casual and not too ritzy. It was also very family oriented.\n\nI REALLY recommend the brussel sprout salad. I looove salad and this is one of the best ones I've had in a while. Don't let the name scare you off.. I'm not always the biggest fan of the brussel sprouts (when I was 5 I barfed at the Christmas Dinner table when having them for the first time).. It doesnt have that bitter flavor at all, and the bacon bits and dressing.. mmmm	4
307	This place is a great find for the AYCE (all you can eat) sushi lovers out there. The restaurant has a great selection for both lunch and dinner and the price is pretty decent as well. The sushi was all really good and they don't try and fill you up with a whole bunch of rice.\nI would recommend this place to anyone that enjoys a good AYCE sushi meal from time to time	3
308	"Despite a previous review, The sis, kids and myself checked out the monkey Joes on woodlawn and were greeted by a very friendly hostess and for 4 bucks were able to bring a 2 yr old and 1 year old in.  There are about 7 inflatable \""moon walks\"" with 5 of them having slides or having easily maneuverable climbing walls for the 2 year old.  My only complaint was we were told two different things by different employees concerning the 1 year old we brought.  While sliding down the slide with her an employee said that we had to not go down with her.  This proved problematic since she lacks the strength to pull her body up the climbing walls.  So eventually it clarified with the manager and we were able to assist her on the rides.  Overall, Great time and will go back when they visit again!  So, check it out if you have a lil one, I doubt they'd be disappointed... after all, it's more about them, than it is us!"	2
309	I promise I am going to give this place another shot at providing a better experience.  I always want to write a great review of a place.  Their sushi was really good, although i took it to go, it might have been even better if i ate it there.\n\nThere seems to be a pretty good happy hour menu that is on my list of happy ours to try.\n\nAs I was waiting, I noticed the music was loud, so conversations might be a little hard to have here.  The prices are pretty much in line with other valley sushi restaurants.\n\nSo I hope to actually dine in and upgrade my review.	2
310	Home away from home. Great selection of Cigars, wrist watches and shaving products. Great place to hang out and have a smoke and watch sports on 6 large tv screens. No membership fees and you can also store you collection in the back room free of charge. Highly recommend Cigar King.	4
311	"I truly do love the Jabbawockeez. The things they did on ABDC were extraordinary and it transcended the hip hop dance group genre for years to come. The masks they don are a trademark and it's so huge in the scheme of marketing and style. The numbers they performed on MTV really captured the imaginations of audiences and the masks themselves allowed them to provide a physical humor as well. I'm a hip hop dancer myself and it was incredible watching them week after week wowing audiences. \n\nThey have added additional dancers (several actually) and are doing all brand new numbers. The theme \""Prism\"" deals with colors and how it works into the show and our lives too.  The show is definitely geared towards families although some of the jokes are supposed to fly over the head of kids and get a chuckle out of high schoolers and adults alike. I really enjoyed the pretty neat production of the show. Flashy lasers, bright colorful lights, LED screens and thumping sound systems. The humor to me anyways had me cracking up. I enjoy how the Jabbawockeez embraced themselves as dancing mimes and they work it really well into the skits. The crowd interaction midway through the show is a good way to connect with the people.. although I felt it may have dragged on a little long. \n\nSince I have seen the show twice, once when I first moved here and recently last night,  I have to be as honest as possible from my dancers perspective (first), I'd like to believe the show, with it's top notch production and sick lighting lacked some of the energy that's needed to truly wow the audience. Some of the movements were missing that \""punch\"" of energy and precision that provides the illusions to the moves themselves. It's really noticeable imo if you compare some of their older work to how they move now. Maybe 2 shows a night for 5-7 days a week can be taxing and it's just not easy to be synchronized from start to finish... but unfortunately it's expected from them. \n\nSome of the numbers desperately needed more on the choreography front too. Again, Jabba is known for creating the illusions and sometimes it seems like they are simply doing a choreographed number we see at a normal hip hop class at a local dance studio. If the numbers are lacking on top of the effort of the movement, it's tough to embrace the things that made America love them. \n\nOn a more positive note, I still have to give them credit on a few pieces that still made me say \""Siccckkkkkk\"" like two man number on \""I got 5 on it\""  and their final battle scene. Their natural charm through their movements will always be endearing to people, especially kids. But for the hardcore lovers of dance and an even casual fan... I'd love to just see them break more boundaries and step up on the effort."	2
312	Decent food. We ordered cod fish tacos and salmon with quinoa which was listed as lifestyle menu. My entree side was kale salad which was not my favorite. Drinks were good and service was nice but slow.	3
313	Pretty good BBQ,  pulled turkey was a little dry but the green been casserole and the mac and cheese redeemed it for 3 stars. The ambiance is cool so i would still definitely come back. Live music outside is a huge plus.	2
314	Expensive (more than dealership), not fast, and they REALLY do some up-selling.	0
315	"We live literally across the street and have been wanting to come here for a year since moving in. We did last night, and it was great.\n\nBefore ever visiting, Louisiane has a really lovely vibe, candlelit seats spread along the sidewalk. It always looked very enticing, and it was, both inside and out.\n\nThe menu is southern/cajun food, which was a first for us, which was nice. We ordered a chicken soup, green salad, crab cakes, to start. And then we had the dinosaur beef ribs and sizzling firecracker shrimp as mains. We also got two bottles of wine.\n\nEverything was really yummy, the chicken soup/green salad were good. The crabcakes / dinosaur ribs though, were amazing. The crabcakes starter comes as 5-6 small little balls which you can dip and eat. And the ribs, were honestly, some of the best I ever had in my life. \n\nAlso, all of the staff were also super nice. I say all, because unlike other restaurants where if you ask another employee for something, they will say \""I'll get your server.\"" At Louisiane, said person just did the task, happily. Which is how it is in the Europe/Australia, unlike North America etc. \n\nWe had a really lovely dinner. Every aspect was great.\n\nHowever, the one downside to this place, is that I find it is a tad expensive. Most things on the menu feel a little bit marked up than they should be, I feel. But that said, unlike many other marked up restaurants around the city, La Louisiane offers something that is incredibly unique, and executed very well. For a long time, we only stuck to going to BYOW restaurants if we ever wanted wine, because of the intense markup on bottles especially. However, because Louisiane is unique, and offers a great seating, atmosphere and food, it can be argued that the pricing is justified. I'd return for sure."	3
316	Awesome location, cool place....the Chopped Salad is by far the most amazing salad I have ever had in my life (but way...and I mean way to small)...If it were double the portion for the price I would probably visit more. I had a flight when I was there...it took forever (as I know flights are supposed to)...but this was ridiculous...the buffalo meat is so gross...it reminds me of when a stray dog visits my lawn...\n\nThe BBQ sauce is good....the staff is just OK. Nothing mind blowing. I think staff in a place with a pricey menu should spoil the guests a bit...Give away a free desert when you know the service and meal is just OK...this may bring your customer base back to visit just because you redeemed yourself at the end.\n\nOverall its a cool place. It fits with the downtown Scottsdale lifestyle. But stay away from the buffalo, because it will give doggy bag a whole new meaning....	2
317	I was excited when I found this place and was hoping for an authentic experience, BUT my expectations fell short....the staff was nice. That's about all I can say that was good. The menu was horribly put together! You can't sell your food if your menu looks very displeasing to the eye. As for the food..........they need to bring in a waaaaaay better chef or kick the person who gave them the recipes that are currently being used. Nothing tasted like how it should and everything was cooked below amateur level. I really wanted to like this place, but just couldn't. Plus Da Lat is where my entire family is from...so I definitely would know what the food should taste like.	1
318	Rude, rude, rude.  The clerk today was put out by my business.  My fiance warned me but I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.  She failed to greet me; didn't want to count the items; delivered 2 pieces of disappointing news with a look and a tone that spoke volumes (TOUGH),\nNo, little girl, tough for you!  We will be going elsewhere in the future.	0
319	This place it is not a buffet and will not honor the 15% stays the contract has expired,therefore will not do it. Overprice and unfriendly customer service.	0
320	Breakfast is always reliable here.  The omelets are always made just as ordered, the California Ham and Eggs has a nice big slice of ham again (got small for a while but back to size now - at a premium price too) and you can get raisin toast instead of white or wheat, a nice touch.	3
321	Overall I had a wonderful experience when visiting the salon for the first time. I came into the salon and was greeted by the attendant to wait for my stylist. I had my haircut scheduled with Vanessa and she was punctual on time. I was looking for a trim on my layers and a polished look - and it was done! After that I had asked Vanessa if she had room for a walk-in service right after me, as my mother was looking to get her hair cut (she had gotten it colored at another salon the same day, and it was her day off, so she doesn't have a lot of time on her hands). Luckily Vanessa was able to accommodate her the same day and we both came out with gorgeous, fresh hair cuts done! We will both be back again, thank you Canyon Falls and Vanessa for being so accommodating!	4
322	We used to go here all the time as a gang of ravenous undergraduates because BYO and a huge inexpensive mound of pasta within walking distance of your tiny crowded apartment just makes sense at that age. I hadn't been back in a while but Matt and Cindy's recent UYE (unofficial yelp event) brought me back and made me realize that inexpensive mounds of good food at a BYO never stops being a good idea, and is especially wise on Mondays. \n\nI ordered the Surf and Turf because at $24 this has to be one of the cheapest quality deals for steak, shrimp and pasta in town. The pasta was fresh and the sauce pure cream and butter goodness. The shrimp were really good, not fishy at all, and the steak was kind of amazing, super tender, juicy and perfectly medium rare in a light wine gravy.\n\nAll in all a very satisfying yummy meal made better by the vines and stained glass and the exceptionally adorable company.	3
323	Amazing dinner. \nEscape to Vegas with my men left us wanting hearty man food. \nWho better than Ramsey to deliver? \nGet the sides, Mac n cheese, creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes.\nSteak cuts rib eye and NY strip to die for. Don't be late- they will hold it against u.	4
324	"Called in a to go order for a quick meal on a Sunday night for my wife and I. Was immediately greeted by one of the staff as I walked in and directed to the take away counter. During my short walk to the counter I found the restaurant to have a nice visual ambience and trendy modern decor with music that might have been just a touch loud. Overall, seems like it would be a decent place to go for a quick meal. The girl who brought my order was friendly and I was in and out very quickly.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the \""One Thousand Bean\"" open face pita and my wife ordered the Pesto Lavosh Turkey Wrap. The bean pita had a fairly substantial pita with a layer of brown rice and medley of cooked beans with tomato, cilantro, and red onion as garnish. Overall, the ingredients were all quality and fresh. The bean blend gave it a nice mix of flavors but overall I felt like it was missing some spice and perhaps a little citrus or something to brighten up the flavors. My wife's wrap left similar impressions. The turkey was surprisingly good with a touch of honey sweetness without being overkill like a lot of other deli turkey. It also had a nice pesto and the grilled tomatoes added a nice touch but overall it still seemed a bit plain tasting.\n\nAll in all, the food was made with quality ingredients and was good albeit a bit plain. Prices seemed a touch high at first but I think the quality and portions justify it. Will likely go back to try more in the future."	3
325	Tasteless burrito. I'm not picky, but the food is not good. The 2nd star is only because the Churro is quite good.	1
326	"I have been ordering from metro for four years now and every time I order it has gotten progressively worse. I used to think they were one of the better pizzas in Vegas, that don't say much because most pizza out here is terrible in comparison to the Brooklyn pizza I am used to. \nWhat has totally turned me away from metro Pizza is the recent run around I had with my take out order. I ordered two dinners and two salads. The eggplant dinner was extremely greasy and burned, then when I got to the bottom of my salad there was a 6inch diameter piece of plastic at the bottom of my salad. Now having eaten most of my meal I was so sick to my stomach I vow to never eat from Metro Pizza again. When I called back to tell the manager and get a refund she was rude didn't believe me and was reluctant to give me any attention. I felt I deserved better service then this especially since I belong to their \""pizza\"" club. In this club they send me coupons that are practically useless, and if I save eight pizza clippings from the mailer I can get one pizza free, if I dine-in. Now these coupons if your lucky come once a month so I have to wait about a year of eating pizzas from this crap place to get one free?? I should get one free just because metro pizza charges way too much for a regular pizza as it is. All in all, this place will never get my business again."	0
327	Alright, I live within waking distance, so that factors into me and my family eating here pretty often. We're new to the 'Burgh, so we didn't know about the chain before we moved here. The food is always good. We've explored the menu and have never been unsatisfied. Big plus: the sundae bar!!!! It's worth the trip in and of itself. \n\nThe only downer about this location are the hours. They close at 8:00 or something. And only open on Sunday if there's a Steeler/Pirate game in town that day. I can't tell you how many people I've seen try and dine here when they're closed. Also, they're always understaffed. It's turned into somewhat of a running joke with us: the staff expect to be slow but they get slammed every night we're there! So the servers end up with 10 tables or so. And there's never a hostess to seat guests, so people just end up wandering in and seating anywhere. This adds to the chaos. It's almost painful to watch. But the staff is very friendly, for the most part. Only once have I been upset at service and it was with a to-go order. The bartender took my order and didn't write anything down. I knew it was a bad sign but didn't say anything. Sure enough, the whole order was f'd up. We called and complained and they comped us a meal. So all was well. \n\nBottom line, great place to eat, even though it seems its glory days are behind it. But a little patience and a sundae bar go a long way here.	2
328	"So I used to eat at this location\n\nAnd I loved it\n\nBut slowly\nEach time I ate here\n\nI'd get a tummy ache\n\nThen my boyfriend was all like \""hey, everytime I eat chipotle I get diarrhea\""\n\nSo it wasn't just me!\n\nWe continued to eat here though, because we loved it.\nAnd we'd make sure we had no where to be for a few hours after eating it.\n\nI know, we're weird.\n\nBut we got sick of getting sick.  Poo.  Literally."	0
329	We stopped here in the early afternoon to get some food to take home and enjoy.   I had heard some raves about this restaurant and my hopes were high.  When we stepped in there was no one there to great us at the carry out desk.   Understandable as it was a bit early and not the main entrance area.   We waited about 10 minutes and someone finally noticed us.  They apologized and took our order.\nDuring our wait we had the opportunity to watch the kitchen staff sort of laze about the kitchen area.  They could start with the pans that were left laying on the floor.  The area looked unkempt.   The restaurant looked dark and uninviting.  It reminded me of being back stage after the production of a high school musical.   Sounds a little weird I guess but that is what came to mind.\nThe food arrived in ok time and off we went.\nSome of the flavors were a little better than what you find at Chinese take out places.  The portions were smaller than we expected.  Nothing that spectacular and nothing to rave about.\nMay give them a second chance some day but there are many more places to check out before we go back again.	1
330	Visited some friends staying at this off-strip hotel and had an amazing breakfast. Our server helped us decide on the menu and explained the portions.  They are extremely huge but we had to try a couple of their reviewed dishes. We had Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (it had spinach, hardwood bacon, tomato & mozzarella, chipotle cream, scrambled eggs) and Griddled French Toast (ooey gooey yummy). Wow...talk about enormous! Our server was kind enough to warn about the size and she offered to give us to-go containers so my friend can take it up to his hotel roommate.  We knew we would only eat half of each dish so its all good. I can't speak for the lunch or dinner dishes but their breakfast menu was highly recommended by the concierge and we were more than satifisfied and full! The only downside for me is the drive cause I was staying at the Strip. Next time I'll go to the one on West Sahara or Imperial Palace :)	3
331	not thrilling, not disappointing.  RB is average across the board.  Try the Hazelnut Crusted Chicken.	2
332	Best banana pudding in Charlotte!  Servers are friendly and southern, food is very good.  Be sure to ask about the specials, they often source these from King's farmers market.  They are also happy to share their secret ingredients on the banana pudding, salad dressing, etc.	3
333	When did they get rid of their stamp cards? I have been gone for far too long. That's not the only thing that has changed. I remember coming here often back in high school. Were my taste buds just off or have they changed? I had the honey lemon green tea with aloe vera about a month ago, wasn't bad but didn't taste like how I last remember it. During my most recent visit, I got jasmine milk tea. I expected your average jasmine milk tea... but it came out way too sweet and powdery. I didn't end up finishing the drink, and that never happens.	1
334	"I have been eating here regularly for lunch. Their Chicken \""Country House Salad\"" lunch combo is a very good deal.\n\n$5.99 for a decent sized salad with grilled chicken and mixed greens and a baked potato or soup.\n\nSince it is summer here, I do not like to eat heavy/hot food as I work in the heat most days so this combo is very appealing."	3
335	The tortillas are very good, but the quality of the meat that they place therein is a bit of problem.  The first time I went I had the carne asado burrito, and although the taste was good, I chewed the meat in that thing for an hour and half and my jaw hurt. So the second time I went, I got the chicken burrito figuring the meat would be more tender. It was, but still the quality of the meat was lacking.  Again, the taste was decent. The third time I ordered a egg burrito for breakfast, and I must say that the quality of the eggs they put inside the burrito are just great.\n\nReally low prices and some nice baked goods.  I would certainly buy a bag of the tortillas they sell at the counter.	2
336	I loved this restaurant.\nI travel all over the country and always eat Indian if I can.  Vegetarian friendly.  Gluten Free friendly.\nCasual atmosphere.\nThe staff is overwhelmingly nice, warm, friendly.  By the time we left, I felt like they were friends.  I let them pick out my food using my Gluten Free restrictions and was amazed with my meal.  The Bhel Poori was so unique and filled with flavor.  The dosa tasted like the dosa's that I ate in India.\n\nThe owner(s) sang songs and entertained us unexpectedly.  We meant to pop into the restaurant for a quick meal.....we left feeling like we had a casual night out on the town with new friends.\n\nGo eat at Pyaars!  Then go back.  This place is near a movie theater and is so new that it had no sign yet.  Find it...it will not disapoint!	4
337	What can I say it's The House of Blues, if you've seen one you've seen them all. mostly standing room unless you pay for bottle service or the balcony is open. Good sound I have no complaints.	2
338	"Horrible service. I ordered breadsticks, just breadsticks. It took 45 MINUTES! And the cook was eating while she cooked. Not secret snacking, she was chomping away at the food she was making!!  \nI was not asked size options, is there only one size? My sticks cost $4.50, which I thought was steep, and after, yes after I had already paid, and been given my change,.. she said \""it's going to be 15-20 minutes, is that ok?\"" Well considering you've already taken my money do I have a choice? SO I said yes and waited, tried my damnedest to be patient, when 40 minutes rolled around there was 5 of us standing at the counter saying \""come on, this is ridiculous\"". Because it was!! \n\nPizza Hut was a childhood favorite. I hadn't been to a Pizza Hut in YEARS, and I will NOT be going back :("	0
339	"On Easter weekend, we called Animal Inn regarding their rates.  They informed about their price but failed to tell us about an additional rate being that it's Easter.  They did however, remember to tell us that they close early on Easter Day.\n\nWe brought our Tibetan Spaniel there and she absolutely did not want to go in.  The workers are not friendly and/or accomodating at all.  Terrible service all the way around.  We asked them why they couldn't tell us that there were extra fees over the phone when we called and they just said \""well that's how it is\"".   We would be happy to pay the extra money, but not when they intentionally fail to tell us to accomodate their business.  \n\nUpon picking our dog up, no one greeted me as I entered the door, so I stood there waiting as they were all staring at me, until someone had the descency to acknowledge a customer.  They were rude, very unfriendly, and did not seem to care about the animals.  \n\nOur dog seemed a little traumatized after we brought her home to bathe and feed her.  \n\nI DO NOT recommend this place to anyone!"	0
340	I expected more of the Rosehip.. Hence only 2 stars.\n\nIt was a cold Thursday night, I had a long day behind me and what I was looking for now was a nice dinner out. My husband and I had bought a itison voucher for a steak meal at Rosehip some time ago and decided to make use of it finally.\n\nAfter arriving at the restaurant, we got a table in the upstairs area. Ordered 2 glasses of wine and they bought over a bottle.. No big deal, it was rectified swiftly.\n\nMy husband ordered a brie starter: 3 smallish triangles of fried brie which came with sweet chili sauce and salad. It was delicious, and just the right amount for a starter.\n\nA while later, our main courses arrived. The deal was for a 8oz sirloin steak served with grilled tomato, onion rings, hand cut chips and garlic butter. \nInstead of chips we got potato wedges - again not a big issue but I'm more a chips/fries kind of girl. Especially if they are 'shoestring fries' :)\nThe onion rings were lovely, and I ate them quickly before they went cold.\nThe steak itself was quite nicely cooked, but it had quite a few fatty bits which I had to discard. It didn't have as much flavour, but the accompanying peppercorn sauce was nice - it wasn't too strong or peppery.\nThere was no garlic butter, but to be honest I didn't need it anyway. \n\nIt was time to pay.. They brought over the bill and we noticed that they had charged for a full bottle of wine instead of 2 glasses. They apologised and brought over the right amount of change.\n\nThe waiting staff were all very friendly and that was the positive thing about Rosehip. Food wasn't quite up to my liking but perhaps I've been spoiled by Kyloe when it comes to steaks.	1
341	I always wanted to try Nobuo's, and I finallly had the chance to check it out. \nThe place is sooo cute, the teeter house really gives you comfortable feeling as soon as you walk inside, you can really relax... great place to grub drinks all night and hang out with your date =D\n\nI had their Tako Age, which reminded me of TAKOYAKI, japanese octupus ball treat deep fried, which was quit interesting, the yuzu mayo sauce went really well with it. \n\nTheir Oyster/Uni dish is amaaazing. I never thought tomatoe would match so well with uni!! it was also one of the  freshest I had in town =D \n\nTheir okonomiyaki really made me home sick , it really dose taste like a real thing in osaka =D\n\nwaitress was friendly, and she knew her menu, \nolong tea i had was yummy too, and they have great selection of wine and sake. \n\nFood is small portion,and it dose take a lil time to come out, but i can taste the delicate art in each dish, which to me is totally worth it. If you love food and respect art of food, you have to try this place =D\n\nI am going back next time for his Omakase... mMmmmm Over all, I'm glad phx has at least one place thats not like other resutrants, I love this place	4
342	We switched from the Venetian to the Paris, so we were spoiled by the room size and opulent bathroom at the previous hotel. I'll try to not let that influence this review.\n\nAverage sized rooms. Nice staff. If you want a crepe, go for the buffet. An a la carte crepe is $10. For $15 you can get an all you can eat buffet WITH all u can eat creeps! Check in on four square for the $5 off buffet coupon. \n\nNot as smoking as some of the hotels we visited which is great if you have Ida and don't want to expose them to prolonged smoke on the way to the room. Much smaller shopping area than Caesars or Venetian.  Connected to the monorail through Bally's but you'll have to take your family through the Bally's Casino to access it.  centrally located.\n\nOnly gambled at 3 tables all night because the dealers at those tables were so pleasant. Glad we stayed there.	3
343	I was excited to try this out based on the reviews and the fact that a friend had recommended it. However, I would never come back. The menu was extremely confusing and had a number of dishes. However, once served, a lot of the food tasted the same. The escargots were overcooked, chewy and rubbery. The actual meal that I did have, lobster raviolis, was covered and baked in an inch think of cheese. The veal medagalioni was questionable. I don;t even know if it was fully cooked because the pasta was so think. It was greasy and not appetizing at all! I was thoroughly disappointed. I would not come here unless you want to leave feeling disgusting and paying for something that is a guaranteed stomach ache!	0
344	I havent been to many clubs but out of the ones i have been this one I was not a fan of. I just was thankful that my friend's friend was able to get us in for free for her birthday. It was so hot inside, by the time we walked down the stairs and over to the bar area i had sweat running down my neck and i had not even started to dance. There was one thing i did like most of all and that was when the guys from star wars came out and did a little party dance/celebration and shot out confetti. I had one drink and after that i refused to get another drink just because it was very overpowering(just not my thing). I still had alot of fun and enjoy getting out and celebrating my girl's birthday!!!! But heck I live in vegas so why not try and see what all the clubs in las vegas have to offer.	2
345	This is by far the worse KFC I have ever been to. No matter what I have ordered it takes for ever. The food taste old! We need corporate to come revamp the staff and retrain on the cooking or they won't stay be in business much longer.	0
346	Alright, let's make things nice and sparkling clear.\n\nThis is The Deuce.  Deuce is a term for two.  Number two also means pooping.  Riding this thing takes forever and you wish you just sat in your hotel going number two.\n\nYou get what you pay for.  Going from Planet Hollywood to Downtown took forever and a day.  We ended up taking a taxi back.  $7 for air conditioned rest isn't bad, but if it's nice out just walk the strip.  So much people watching.\n\nTip: If you need to get to downtown and don't want to get gouged by taxis.  Either get a rental, or take the MGM monorail from MGM Grand to Sahara.  Get off @ Sahara and take the Deuce downtown (MUCH LESS STOPS!)	2
347	These cupcakes are extremely nasty. They taste like they are made from a box mix. I can buy 4 boxes of mix for the cost of 1 cupcake. Me thinks not. The cake is extremely dry and the icing is overly sweet, in my opinion. There are other cupcake places in town that are miles better than this one is. \nI wouldnt recommend this place to a person without a tongue.	0
348	Went in on Saturday evening - had a coupon and decided to check it out.  Food was good - they are working on adding more staff.  The staff that was on hand were exceptional! The chef came out and talked with us - what great guy (Tom?)\n\nI think once they some additional help, it will be a great place.  Super beer selection on tap as well.\n\nGood job folks - keep it up!	2
349	Quick review:\n\nWe ate at the sushi place inside and it was delicious! My boyfriend loves it here just because they offer crapless craps... I can safely say that we will probably stop by on our next trip.	2
350	Meh, nice patio but lackluster service if it's busy. I don't think we're cool enough to hang here, at least that's how they made us feel, and no one should feel that way as a paying customer. Not worth a return trip.	1
351	The Carnegie Delicatessen & Restaurant is an overpriced place to eat located on the main floor of the Mirage hotel.  As I was coming home from a night out on the strip,  I decided to grab a late night snack to take back up to my room.  I went with a pastrami sandwich on rye, which turned out to be a vacation changing mistake. \n\nThe sandwich came with a lot of meat and tasted okay, but it was definitely not worth the hefty price.  A few hours after eating the sandwich I was extremely sick, and remained sick for almost two days strait.  I was hardly able to eat anything during my remaining time in Las Vegas, and my sickness made it difficult for me to enjoy the final day of my vacation.  \n\nI will not be easting at the Carnegie Delicatessen & Restaurant again, and will look for better food at a more reasonable price the next time that I am in Las Vegas.	0
352	"This is one of the worse restaurants ever! I must admit their food is somewhat delcious but the service is a big FAT F! My freinds and I decided to dine in late one night. We ordered and as usual these waiters in chinese restaurants are rude which we just ignored. As our order was put in they waiter comes back with our BILL, he stated \"" the cashier is leaving and they were ready to close the register\"". We did not even receive our food and they were already throwing the bill at us. I thoguht that was flat our rude!! even thou the food was good we were not doing to deal with this we got up and left the table! I would not reccomend this place at all! they were closed before for a horrible food inspection grade of F. Your better off eating at panda express!"	0
353	"We planned our trip late and El Monte Las Vegas was the only company with available RVs. In retrospect, a bad sign.  \n- Customer service: We waited 4 hours before anyone would acknowledge us about the RV we reserved. Others renters had been there more than 5 hours waiting to check out. While some of their team members are well intentioned, others sit around unwilling to talk to you unless your name is next on the list. Similarly, returning the RV took 1.5 hours. Add travel time to their location and El Monte ate an entire day of my vacation! \n- Hidden Charges: The RV pricing looks good on the web, but then EL Monte adds on numerous charges and set up fees. Worst of all: Their RVs don't come with bedding or kitchen supplies, but they'll rent these to you at exorbitant rates. For example, a set of pots and dishes that could be purchased for $40 at Walmart cost $125 a week to rent. A set of blankets and sheets for one person rents for $50!\n- Equipment: before we drove off the lot both the toilet and the cap to the fresh water tank needed to be fixed. In the case of the latter, a locking cap was replaced with a cap with no lock,  so potentially someone could access and pour anything into our freshwater tank.  Pretty unsafe. \nOn the road, the whole rig rattled and the engine whined up any incline. My kids named it \""the hunk of junk.\"" These RVs have been ridden hard.\n- My advice: book ahead somewhere (anywhere) other than El Monte, even if it's more expensive. In the end, you'll save money and your precious hours of vacation."	0
354	I was immediately approached when i arrived at the store and they asked me if i needed any help in particular. I said no i was just browsing and they told me to come ask them if i need help with anything... the usual customer service thing.\n\nThere was great selection here at the store, a wide variety of types of bikes you got the a small selection of cruiser and hipster bikes. a pretty solid option for hybrids and commuters. large selections for road, cyclocross, tri, mtb (dh and xc). I purchased a new seat when i was there, very fair pricing, not sure about their in shop/labor pricing didn't ask because it is way too far for me to bring my bike to just for some work. The workers are very knowledgeable in their stuff as i heard them talking to other people who needed specific help with things.\n\nI enjoyed this store, not as big of a selection for bars as i thought, seat selection is small but priced well. \n\nThey have lots of bontrager and trek brand stuff there, so if you love those brands head on over.\n\nThey have lots of information about races and riding information on their brochure stand.	3
355	The wife and I stopped here for a bite and beer and was surprised. The steaks we ordered were huge and very tasty. Overall good beer selection and great service from Robin made foe a great evening.	3
356	This place is amazing. I've had the Fluffernutter and Coffee Coco Loco more times than I can count but tonight I was pleasantly surprised that they had twist chocolate and vanilla. OMG! This place is an absolute must, even my boyfriend who is a very traditional eater likes it. I avoid gluten and dairy and this place fits all my needs while being even more delicious than traditional ice cream. Once I asked if they would leave out the vanilla wafers (gluten) and they replace them with gf animal crackers. AMAZING	4
357	Gorgeous casino, d\u00e9cor scheme seems to be taken from the Bellagio gardens- good mix of stores, restaurants, and gaming. Really appreciate how spacious this casino is, lots of space to walk around without cramming slot machines into every available nook.\n\nService is typically very top notch, and restaurants on site are known for being able to accommodate any dietary restriction and have several vegan, vegetarian, and vegetable-laden options at each.\n\nParking garage is smaller than most but easily accessible, casino itself is on the smaller side but more intimate and upscale rather than crowded and gaudy.	2
358	"God, I hate you Market District.  Most times I come here, I have to restrain myself from screaming at the top of my lungs.  But.....ala Breakfast Club John and Claire, I also love you, and I hate myself for that.  Hence, my 3-star review.\n\nThe Shadyside Market District is great in the sense that they have everything you need.  And then some.  Plus things you didn't even know you needed (buffalo flavored hummus for 6.99?  Sure!  Get in my belly.....I mean, cart).  But, whoa, it's totally over-priced.  As my mom would say \""city prices\"".  And the parking lot is cut-throat; I recommend entering the parking garage on the Negley Side for a slightly-less congested time.\n\nMarket District does make an effort to carry local products and produce, so gotta give them props for that. \n\nNote that only Advantage Card users can utilize the self-checkout, and you have to scan your card first before your food."	2
359	I want to like this place so bad because it is across the street and therefore the most convenience place to eat and drink for my entire building.  This place is horrible. The food is awful and the staff are all snotty.  I have tried to eat there so many times.  The grilled chicken tastes like rubber and is always burned, the bread is always stale and when you speak up to staff about it they give you an attitude like you are making it up.  The only thing positive at this place is their spinach dip.  I have seriously never had a worse experience with food, staff, or a Charlotte bar in total.  DO NOT GO HERE.	0
360	"Wow, I'm surprised to read some of the bad reviews! I guess I am biased, because I ate so much JJ's in college 20 yrs ago. For me the bread is great, toppings have always been plentiful, and I really haven't had any issues to speak of. \n\nHowever, I could understand the \""JJ's business model\"" might be off-putting for some. This is a college/young sub shop. If you don't know what you want you probably feel pressured and may even get run over. It does seem everyone is in a hurry here and curt. So, this is not the best place for somebody looking for a quite lunch and a chat with \""Sam the sandwich maker\"" behind the counter.\n\nWe also habitually get the Beach Club hence we are never surprised, it's always great to us. I have had most sandwiches on the menu - all are good.\n\nAlso, yes you can save a buck & get a bigger sandwich at other places but, for us this is a quality stop once a month for lunch!"	3
361	By far, THE BEST breakfast buffet in Vegas. They've got it all.\n\nBenedict, Crepes, eggs, all meats, wonderful desserts. I would not suggest this buffet at dinner time, but for lunch, you CAN NOT MISS IT!	4
362	Have you ever gone to a restaurant and the food was good, but the service and customer service was so bad that you can't ever walk through the doors again? For me that is my experience at Rosati's tonight. I placed a phone order after looking at their menu that was posted on their website. I had the order amount in my head based on the prices on the website menu. When I questioned the total to the cashier, she printed out the prices. I asked her if she knew that the prices on my bill were different than those on the website menu. She told me something that really didn't make sense. I replied that I thought they should charge me the prices from the website menu. She just gave me my change and didn't even say thank you (I guess the attitude started). I asked to speak with the manager, but she said he wasn't there. If it were my restaurant, I would have gladly matched the prices that were on the website menu, no questions asked or attitude given. Another sorry example of good food that is outweighed by bad and/or rude customer service.	0
363	I love Rosatis but this location has major problems! Since the deep dish takes 45 minutes, we ordered 2 appetizers to munch on while we waited, both were served barely warm. Then when we got our pizza it was barely warm...I went to the DIRTY bathroom and the toilet would not flush. i took off the tank lid and there was no chain to pull up the flapper! Would recommend going to a different location. For a Saturday night it was dead in there and now I know why!	1
364	WARNING:  This nightclub contains bass known to the State of California to cause pace-maker interruption and exacerbation of high blood pressure or other cardiac harm.\n\nLiterally the thudding hurt my otherwise healthy ticker and made me crave the nearest exit. Or maybe it was the seizure inducing flashing lights that would periodically come up to full power for 5 seconds revealing exactly how unattractive those around me were. Or the fact that these momentary flashes also provided me with a glimpse of the space - a huge dirty industrial warehouse. \n\nThe music was decent but enjoyment was truly interrupted by concern for my heart falling out of my chest cavity...if you can imagine.	1
365	I am a regular at the good egg. Ray location on mondays and fulton ranch on tuesdays. And when Im in tucson I'll hit the speedway locaton ( Which by far has the best food!) \n So you would think that the food would all be the same since its  franchise, but its not! the ray location food quality is 3-4star, tucson definitely 5star and Fulton ranch is the worst. so bad I refuse to go there even though its walking distance from my house.	0
366	I like this place for the most part but don't make the mistake of offering the eggs benidict it is sourer.  The poor lemon in it	1
367	We stayed here and I must say that the my stay was indeed very comfortable.  I did not hear any noise from outside (referring to rowdy hotel guests) and our view was of the fire and volcanic displays from Mirage.  \n\nThe bathroom is lovely.. I like that there is a bar-like place to sit in the bathtub.  \n\nI don't know the price of the hotels but it was to cost $150-$170 a night this past weekend however, the boyfriend got free rooms so we took advantage of that.  There is a Starbucks by the elevators, a frozen yogurt / crepe place, and a Southern breakfast type of place all in the same area.  I liked that Hash House A Go Go was right there however, I will never eat there again but Harrah's is right by everything.. \n\nI do have one minor complaint- the A/C would turn off so every time we'd come back, the room would be boiling hot.	3
368	I have nothing but praise for the work of Taylor and Zach at Aniu for the hair and makeup styling they did for my wedding. They completely got what I was looking for and I felt pampered, beautiful and confident as a result. My wedding photos turned out beautifully and I am so happy I went with Aniu for my special day!!	4
369	Pizza delivery fella was really nice. \nOrdering was super easy. I was in a house full of littles that were loud so doing it online was handy. \nThe pizza was ok. I've had better, but I've had worse.\nI had the bbq chicken. I liked the caramelized onions on it. Pepperoni pizza was ok.	2
370	All I have to say - hot waiter!\nOh, and the pizza was awesome too.\n:)	3
371	I am new to the area and visited this CVS for the first time to pick up a prescription.  I WILL NOT be returning.  First, I waited in line for 10 minutes to pick up the script- there was one person at the counter and two other people ahead of me.  When I finally got to the counter, the script wasn't ready even though it had been called in over an hour before I arrived (what's the hold-up?).  The Pharmacy Technician yelled for them to expedite it (great!) and told me to have a seat while they finished filling the script.  Ok.  I sat and listened... and listened... after 10 minutes I asked another Pharm Tech approximately how long it would be until my script was ready.  He looked and told me it was ready.  I asked why nobody had called me and he said he didn't know.  I got back in line again to check out... this time there were five people ahead of me.  After waiting another 15 minutes there's finally only one person ahead of me... the lady at the counter has a cart load of items and the Pharm Tech asks if she'd like to pay for her items there.  I can't say I blame the customer- if I had other items, I wouldn't want to wait in another line, but seriously, there's quite a line of people who can't check out up front at the general registers- let's serve the people to need to use the pharmacy.  She checks out and then proceeds to question the price of baby-wipes (buy one get one half off that didn't ring out as such).  So now the only person checking people out at the Pharmacy is doing a price check for baby-wipes while the rest of us continue to wait.  Finally, a second Tech arrives and takes the woman in front of me and then takes me.  I explain to him my frustrations as it has taken me over 30 minutes to pick up my script and that NOBODY called me when the script was ready.  The Pharmacy Manager tells me that she did call me and I didn't hear her.  I told her I was sitting in the chairs and nobody called her.  She proceeds to say she speaks fast and I probably didn't understand her.  I'm from New York- we don't know how to speak anything except fast- don't insult me!  I continued to explain my frustrations- having to wait in line twice, nobody telling me the script was ready, etc.  She asked how she could address the situation but at that point there was nothing they could do- I had already spent nearly 40 minutes picking up a script that the doctor had called in over an hour before I even arrived.  At this point, I just wanted to get out.  As I left, another customer told me how rude  I was and that I needed to be more patient!  Haha!  Mind your own business- I don't have time to spend 40 minutes picking up a prescription!  When I got home, I was told that CVS has called to say the script was ready- yup, even though I was sitting less than five feet from the counter, they called HOME rather than me!  This pharmacy needs a lesson in customer service and efficiency because both were seriously awful.  I mentioned that I am new to the area- I recently relocated from Chicago and always used CVS there.  My doctor would call in a script and within 10 minutes, the CVS would have it filled (the time it would take me to walk the 2 blocks from my doctor's office to the CVS).  The couple times the CVS was backlogged, they'd have me take a seat but as soon as the prescription was ready, they'd call me up and check me out immediately- I NEVER had to wait in line TWICE!!!  I always had such wonderful experiences at the CVS in Chicago but will definitely not be using this CVS again.  There are several Walgreens and Rite Aids in the area- I'll be using them from now on.	0
372	I came across Sushi Too as I was searching for a dinner place. The set up and service was nothing fantastic but it still worked. A few tables and booths scattered inside the restaurant. \n\nThe portions were pretty large. I ordered a seaweed salad and a huge bowl of it came. I rolled out of the restaurant after having 2 special rolls and a bottle from their selection of beers. There were a number of regular and special rolls, deluxe platters, different appetizers, and cooked entrees.	2
373	This place reminds me of a fast food joint, quality of food isn't that great, but I'll still come here if I'm in the mood of mexican food and I'm at the red rock casino. Other than that it's not all that great, I'd rather go to other restaurants in the food court. Not much of a big fan here. Taqueria's blow this place away, but this particular place I'd settle for if I want a burrito or taco's of some sort. Ehhhh	1
374	L	4
375	Great steak experience! We had an awesome experience with the server last year; this year he's average but the food is a. Ma. Zing as always!	3
376	I have been here many times because it's right by my work and convenient to go at lunch, but I'm not going anymore - it's just not worth it. \n\nif you have to wait, there is no where to sit or stand basically. everyone is packed in there like sardines. I also don't like how the nail technicians try to push all th extra services onto you when doing the pedi\n\non the last pedicure I got from them, my pinky toe was totally messed up and after about 2 weeks, my toe nails began to turn yellow (the polish that is). I hadn't been hanging out in the sun or anythign so there's no reason it should have done that. once I had the polish removed (somewhere else), my nails were fine, so it was definitely their polish. \n\nin addition, my friend had a gel manicure here and it chipped within minutes of leaving.\n\nI'm done giving this place chances	0
377	This is old-school Sonoran food. It's good! Hot sauce, chips, guacamole (though I think it has sour cream in it), enchilada sauce (both green and red), tacos, crispy cheese crisps, tasty medium-heat green chiles -- all good! \n\nThe only item that was lesser to my taste was the chile relleno, though the red tomato sauce on it was delicious.\n\nGive it a shot. There's a reason why this restaurant has been successful for so long.	3
378	I went here two times during my week in Montreal.  The first time I ordered the smoked meat sandwich and poutine.  The sandwich was rather bland, nothing to write home over, but the poutine parisienne was really good.  Another night I ordered the pasta alfredo....it was horrible!!!  It was bland, tasteless, for $16 came with no salad or piece of bread, it was like spaghetti with Elmer's Glue.  I wouldn't recommend that dish, there are other places you can go for much better pasta!\n\nThe service was so-so.  I ordered to go both times and the waitress was attentive enough, but as I sat there watched the wait staff play and text with their phones.  Hilarious.  This Dunn's is also located right next to a XXX massage parlor....just an FYI if you're thinking about brining the kids lol.	2
379	"I have tried this place about 6-8 times since moving here in 2002 because others rave about it, and I keep thinking it will be different but every time I seem to get something bland. Ordered some sort of peanut-spicy chicken thing and it was basically flavorless and the onions were raw. Are they in a hurry or something? \""Chicken\"" tasted thin and rubbery. Place was SUPER noisy - do NOT go on a date there! Ling and Loiue's on Shea and 96th blows this place out of the water in every category."	0
380	Norm's has become my go to breakfast joint in Summerlin. The food is good, service is good, good is ample and wifi is free and fast. \n\nThe bread/toast is excellent and may be my favorite part of the meal when I order eggs. The wheat pancakes are probably my favorite thing on the menu.	4
381	A tiny, hidden museum tucked inside a coffee shop/art collective in the hip, cool area of downtown? Sounds intriguing? Let me tell you, it is. I came across this place when I was just trying to walk off my lunch. I saw a sign and could not resist the pull to walk in. I have a bit of an obsession with the glamour of old burlesque and have read an inordinate amount of information about Gypsy Rose Lee. This was like visiting a holy place I didn't even know existed. \nI chatted for a few minutes with the front counter woman. She was super nice, friendly and had lots to say about the museum. It consists of a few pictures and some costumes, letters and playbills. Per the young lady, they rotate their displays fairly constantly due to the space restrictions. Its only about the size of one room. \nThis stop was worth it just for the great conversation. This lady was so knowledgeable about not just burlesque but about Las Vegas. I really wish I would've taken her name. She deserves a shout-out. She gave me directions back  to the bus stop and even went through her entire t-shirt stock to find me a size small. I took home a light pink Blaze Starr top. It'll be great for the gym \nIf you have even a slight interest in burlesque, this is a great place to spend a few minutes.	4
382	Not really a fan of anything they offered food and service was not even worth writing a full review!!	1
383	My good pal Jeff C. was so kind to give a girl a sample of the Fairytale Original brownie....\n\n2 words: Not Impressed....\n\nI was expecting more from Eileen Spitalny and David Kravetz but instead got a crumbly, way too softty, chocolate disaster....literally when I went to give a piece for a friend to try it broke in half....I know soft is yum but too soft is 15 thumbs down....\n\nI expected something that would please my palate but instead recieved a rude awakening....	0
384	No wonder great clips is taking their business. They just can't get it right. super cuts has a long ways to go in hiring quality stylists if they want to keep up. I have come out twice feeling something is off and I only come here when the Great clips line is too long\n\nThe hair stylists are always not always smiling, although the manager is friendly.	1
385	It is what it is, but what it is, is great.  This new bar literally is a whole in the wall.  But its quite convenient for the area and a great spot for a quick drink.\n\nThe only way you'll probably find this place is if your walking from the main parking lot of the music factory to the entrance of Bask, Butter, The Saloon and such.  Its on the corner where seaboard takes a hard turn.\n\nThe only other place you can get a reasonably priced beer in this complex is at VBGB, which is also a great spot, but not so great for a quicky beer.  \n\nSmall bar has $2 beers at all times.  Last night it was can's of Rolling Rock and pints of lionheart.  $3 22's of PBR and $4 22's of Budweiser products ain't to bad of a deal either.  They also have a nice booze selection, but didn't ask if there were any specials on all that.\n\nAll in all, my first line said it the best.  Check it out, it comes in handy, but its not where I'm gonna spend my Saturday night.	4
386	I get upset often at this store. While the employees seem very nice and are always more than helpful. Over and over this store has many problems. Often I don't get the sale price on purchases and have to drive back since I don't catch it while they are ringing it up. Many times I've seen out of date products on the shelf and sometimes I accidentally purchase some of them. One time I went in to buy limes and all the limes had mold on them.(my picture is terrible and I couldn't capture all the mold)  I did speak to the manager about it and he said the limes were fine when you wipe the mold off and then he was at the limes wiping off the mold.\n\nYESTERDAY in the meat department they had large packs of beef with stickers on them that said 96% and I could tell just by looking at them that it wasn't. Then I noticed the price sticker said 80% I brought this to the attention to someone from the meat department and instead of fixing the packs he told me that the meat was OK. \n\nI don't think that's OK. Some people do have health issues and need to have the correct fat content.\n\nSadly The near by Fry's is even worst and I haven't been there in over a year since I kept buying spoiled meat from them and that is why I can't give this place one star.	1
387	Great happy hour spot.  Very tasty food and cheap prices during happy hour.  Use the Yelp check in to get a 1 cent house shot, which is usually 5 bucks.  Love the steak tostadas and the margaritas are excellent.	3
388	Never a great sign when you enter a giant restaurant for dinner and the place is completely empty. The next red flag was the menu that was enormous, I am talking on par with the ridiculousness of Cheesecake Factory. Since the menu had my head spinning I went the safe route with the chicken tender plate. My girlfriend ordered a Thai chicken inspired meal and her mom ordered a salad. I will say again the restaurant was pretty much empty, it took nearly 45 minutes for us to receive our meals. My chicken was decent, I think I expected it to be worse but it was nowhere near the wait I could have went to Bojangles for the same quality. \n\nAlso, this place had the saddest beer menu ever.	1
389	Big, crowded, popular eatery.  Food is good, not great but I'm a food snob.  Girls at reception desk were too busy flirting with guy to greet guests, had to wait several minutes till they finally noticed I was standing there.  Ate at the bar, Jeremy the bartender was fantastic with great service and recommendations.	2
390	We ate here on a Friday night and were able to get right in. The food was quick and fantastic! I wanted to take three more orders to go. If I had the room in my hotel mini fridge I would have. Noodles were cooked perfectly. The pot stickers were made from scratch which is hard to find sometimes. The fried wontons were filled with something other then cream cheese which was a really nice change. The sake was one of the best we've ever had. Would recommend this place to everyone.	4
391	Food was ok, but extremely expensive for being average. $48 dollars for a pound of king crab legs, that were old, dry and small.\nService was terrible tonight. Think our waiter came by only three times, to take our order, to bring our food, then the bill...took about 20 mins to get the bill and another 10min to get my change...	1
392	Bummer. I was just there a month ago and had a good sandwich. Stopped by Friday 7/27 and the place is closed with paper over all the windows.	0
393	A very nice dinning experience.	2
394	This place is neat because the bar and restaurant are both open 24 hours. We came in at 10:30PM and were able to take a seat in the dining area even though everyone else was at the bar. The bartender ended up being our waitress and was super nice and helpful with the menu. According to my husband, she was not stingy on the gin:tonic ratio, so definite pluses to that. Since she had to do everything, service was sometimes a bit slow, especially when it got closer to midnight and people began flocking in, but that's okay because it wasn't her fault. \n\nOur 3 course Groupon feast was as follows:\n\nRound Reubens - we ordered these against Ashley B.'s warning, and those things are seriously heavy and packed with so much sodium, you'll be drinking water like a fish for the next 24 hours. The breading is super thick and full of corned beef. I wish there was more sauerkraut to cut through the grease and that they used a different batter! \n\nPittsburgher - a half pound hamburger patty with cheese, french fries (yes, inside!), and coleslaw. I'm actually quite embarrassed to say how much I enjoyed this, but it's true. I am a total closet fatty and if you want to put fries on my cheeseburger, so be it, no opposition over here! It was the best thing we ate all night. We added the Twisted Irish Potato to this and the only thing I could compare this to is undercooked potato chips: sad and soggy. \n\nFish & Chips - if I had known it was the same batter as the Round Reubens, I would have stayed away! They were really heavily battered and the fish didn't flake apart. In fact, they were pretty difficult to pull apart, and chew for that matter. \n\nIrish Car Bomb Brownies - I'm not much of a drinker and I could really taste the Guinness and Whiskey which turned me off of these. \n\nOverall, the food was not great and in retrospect, we ordered some really heavy stuff and should have opted for a salad as a second entree. The sweet bartender and her generous drinks along with the Pittsburgher were its saving graces. If you're craving something super deep fried or a stiff drink in the middle of the night, come visit Murphy's Law.	2
395	Not bad. Not awesome. They had a great drink selection and some cool cocktails. Food was decent, the bacon wrapped wings were okay but really didn't need the bacon since they were swimming in bbq sauce anyway. I enjoyed the signature burger, however. Nice ambiance.	2
396	Really good tacos but overpriced for what it is.	2
397	The teriyaki bowls here are usually pretty good. Unfortunately, the service is usually pretty bad. Come here for the food. Don't come here if you want good customer service!	2
398	I like walmart for their low prices and that is it...their customer service is sub par and eventually I won't shop there at all unless absolutely have to...as far as THIS location (S. Tryon)...I HATE IT. That is all...	0
399	"Ugh. A curry dish with barely any veggies? No, potatoes do not count. They're not green. Even some basil in this so-called  \""basil thai\"" restaurant would have been nice. Curry is hard to mess up because it has such strong flavor. However, given a choice, why go and have bad food?"	0
400	Super veggie pizza. Steve, is always totally friendly. Solid Craft Beer Selection with 10 or so taps.  Why don't they make their apps?..Music is good as well  but they usually have the same groups.  One of my favs in the (51) Corridor.	4
401	Sigh...I so wanted to like Honey Pig...maybe I just need to come back and do their all you can eat.\n\nWe were here Easter Sunday, about 3pm, there was only two other tables in there.  I had a pretty big party- 4 adults & 8 kids, since their tables are kinda small, we had to split up and take two tables.\n\nWe were there early but were told they don't offer the lunch AYCE price ($14.95) on the weekends, they only offer the dinner AYCE prices ( $19.95).  Well, with 8 kids ranging from 14 to 4yrs old, it was not worth the $20 bucks a person since it was a first time for Korean food for most of the kids and we didn't know if they would like it. So, we opted for the $99 combo which came with almost all the meats available.\n\nAll the meats were good but because we split the combo for both tables, we got some things the kids didn't and they got things we didn't.  Overall, the pork belly and bulgolgi was great, the steak was melt in your mouth good, and everything else was just okay.  The salad, I've had better at Mother's and the banchan was a disappointment.  We really only got two banchans and the kim chee was put on the grill...hmm okay..\n\nThe poor waitress was the only one working and she actually helps you grill but since she was the only one, she had to bounce around quite a bit since there was now more tables in the place.\n\nSince we had the kids at their own table, they ordered rice and drinks, while the adults waited and wondered if we were going to get rice..only to have the waitress make us fried rice at the end...hmm, I kinda wanted rice with my meat??\n\nAnyhow, our combo came with a soup that was just okay...usually I like my kimchee jigae.  I also asked for a japchae that never came so I don't even know if we were charged for it.  I know we were charged for ALL the kids rices!!\n\nOverall, it was still a bargain to feed all of us for about $120, but I think I'm going to have to continue my search for that place that serves up 30 banchans!!  Okay I can dream can't I??	1
402	You're likely to score when you hit up Monroe Street, but this place abuses the privilege. The best offering at Brasserie V is definitely the beer selection: they have about 12 on tap every day plus plenty of bottles. They have quite the selection of wine too.\n\nFood's pretty good, modern American and quite tasty. The caprese sandwich was quite good, as were the truffle frites. \n\nPerfect for a first date or happy hour, definitely hit it up!	4
403	"While in town on business, I had an early dinner appointment open up, so I decided to come to Planet Hollywood so I could eat & maybe do some shopping as well before heading back to the airport. I looked up the restaurants online & inteded on going to Yolo's (a Mexican cantina inside the casino), but as I was walking through the Miracle Mile shops, I came across this place & started craving Italian.\n\nThe ambiance is nice. They have a setting for most every need... long & secluded tables for large groups to make it feel family-style, regular seating inside, bar seating with a TV, or patio seating \""outside\"" the restaurant to people watch. The music is kinda loud coming from the Miracle Mile walkway & the A/C was up way too high, so it was freezing cold, but the decor is a nice cross between olde world Italia & contemporary flare, so, overall, it was pleasant.\n\nI came around 3pm, which is after the lunch crowd & before the dinner crowd, so it was pretty empty. They were still serving off the lunch menu, which I'm glad about, because it was a tad bit pricy, so I can imagine what their dinner prices are like.\n\nAs for the food..... delish!! I ordered the Paglia e Fieno which is made with tagliolini pasta (like a flat linguini), chicken, mushrooms, truffle oil & cream sauce. I've never had tagliolini before. Typically, I would've substituted that for fettuccini noodles, but since I've been trying to \""try something new\"" in 2013, I kept it as-is. Glad I did too... I really liked it! I did substitute broccoli instead of chicken, & they cooked it perfectly... not all mushy, yet not raw. The mushrooms were tasty without being overbearing & the cream sauce had a nice consistency & was garlicy. It was a terriffic dish!\n\nI do have to note... after reading another Yelper's review about how good their house bread is, but the difficulty they had in actually receiving any, I was looking forward to getting some which came with my meal, according to the menu. Well, it didn't come out with my meal. After a few moments, I realized this & stopped my waitress asking her, \""excuse me, does this come with bread?\"" She suddendly seemed a bit irritated & replied, \""oh, do you want some?\"" This was almost exactly the same snippy reply the other Yelper got, so I'm guessing this was the same waitress &, no, she wasn't just having an off day. And when she brought the bread out without any butter or anything & I asked her for some oil & vinegar, she acted like it was such a task! Very strange, because other than this bread ordeal, she was a pretty good waitress.... what is it about this bread?! Lol (Minus 1 star)\n\nAnywho, like I said, other than that, the experience was fine & the food was great. I'll probably be back."	2
404	Since it is an older establishment, they are starting some renovations starting in the casino, which is where I have been at. The gambling atmosphere is pretty good, they have dancing girls which is cool. A nice classic touch are the Flamingo girls who stand outside waiting for you to take a picture with them. Party on!	2
405	"What's to be said?....   it's Walmart's version of \""big box retail\""...  I it's huge, clean and has friendly staff."	2
406	Ok. Here's the deal. \n\nMy buddies and I come for a week every year. This property is our choice for $1 dollar Blackjack, decent location, and affordable rooms. This is a 'dude' trip where accommodation aren't that important. \n\nOne caveat - if you like playing cheap Blackjack this is the place. But they only bring this option a couple a times a year. We go every June and seem to hit this 'special offer' annually. So, if you're booking in the fall I doubt they will have these tables available unless you play between the hours of 4-6 AM. \n\nAnother caveat is getting your room comp'd. Simply get a players card and play at the tables each night for about $50 buy in. I often would wager $5 when the pit boss was around and then would bump down to a buck when they weren't looking (usually when I was stemming the losses). You could easily put together an hour at the table. Cash out after an hour and VOILA you'll get a free room at the end of your stay if you ask them to verify your points on the players card. \n\nWe don't bring our wives because we'd then choose a different property. The rooms are a little outdated. You will rarely have a room with a decent view simply by the configuration of the hotel property. \n\nThe pool is usually clean, you can always find a lounge chair to sizzle beneath the sun (unlike the Mandalay), and they serve Newcastle. \n\nThis place ain't velvet but more like a soft polyester.	2
407	The Manager went out of his way to make us feel welcome and make our bike trip to the restaurant one that we won't forget.  Really friendly staff.  I think this new little restaurant has a lot of potential and room to grow into a great place to have breakfast and lunch.	3
408	Our server was pretty cranky. We have a large group (8 adults and 5 kids under 4 years of age), which I know can be stressful. But the service was terrible and the food mediocre. There weren't enough table settings (and they never got us any more, so none of the kids had silverware). The only upside is thy the food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly.	1
409	Well, the Nachos were great. That's all the food we had, atmosphere was good.  Don't do the oyster shooters, canned oysters, not good!!!   The Tatuado Tequila shots we tried were bad, sort of tasted like vodka.  Some one there needs to taste that stuff, the bartenders didn't even know what it was supposed to taste like. The Margaritas were decent, have had a lot better though.	1
410	THEY HAVE THEIR LIQUOR LICENSE!!!\nThe crepes - savory as well as sweet - are complimented by soups and salads.  What matters most is that everything is fresh and made to order. The owner and chef is attentive and passionate about her food and wants to please. We were here three times the week we discovered it!	4
411	I felt like I was whisked away to San Francisco or San Diego when I stepped foot in here. The line was nearly out the door for lunch but it moved quickly. I took my order to go afraid I wouldn't find an open spot, but tables did turn over quickly too. I love the concept happy and healthy, it ought to please everyone. I opted to stay on the healthy side TBLT with sweet potato fries. The sandwich packed a lot of flavor and it was quite good. I'd definitely get it again. They also make a tasty sweet potato fry. The were a bit limp by the time I got them back to the office so next time I'd like to try them fresh. I'll take my chances and dine in.	3
412	"Hyde Park, What happened?! \n\nMy wife and daughter took me here today for my birthday and it was a absolutely horrible experience! The service was so so slow. We ordered our meals 10 minutes after we sat down and it took 40 minutes for me to get my shrimp cocktail appetizer. We had to ask for bread because we were so hungry from waiting. \n\nIt took another 30 minutes for me to get my lobster bisque that had no lobster in it what so ever, my wife to get her salad and my daughter to get her burger and fries. \n\nMy wife and I both ordered The Filet Mignon and Crab Cakes. The supposed Filet Mignon tasted like liver and my crab cakes were burnt and full of filler with little if any crab meat at all. We complained to the floor manager and she got the \""Guest Service Manager\"" Matthew S. He was very apologetic and took our meals, drinks and desserts off our bill. He only charged us for my shrimp cocktail and my daughter's cheeseburger. \n\nBefore today we went to Hyde Park four to five times a year. It's a shame because that dinner totally ruined my birthday. \n\nI'm not sure if I'll ever go back!"	0
413	Lobster pot stickers, divine Butterfish, seared Ahi , chocolate lava cake all to die for!!	4
414	"I heart Matt! He must  be  some kind of food saint. No make that a food angel , well whatever he does, he has the magic touch. \n\n We had a super delicious breakfast this morning. My husband and arrived about 9:00 am after riding  the metro rail ( get off on Roosevelt  station   FYI )  waited about 20 minutes for our  table. We  had a great waiter who was fast, courteous and attentive. \n\nOur order of pancakes, breakfast sandwich, and omelet arrived really quick. My husband quickly exclaimed \""Oh my gosh this is so good\"", and it was.  We were so thrilled with our fabulous breakfast that the family waiting for a table outside was giggling at us.  Laugh away we  are eating good while your party of 7 waits, HA! !! \n\nThe food  had a super fresh taste. The breakfast sandwich had rich caramelized onions  that really enhanced the flavor of ham  and eggs on a tasty soft roll.  My pancakes were light and fluffy and I secretly envied the ability to get them that light and tasty.  The syrup  was served hot and rich.  The omelet  was smooth and cheesy and literally was falling off the plate it was so big.  Did I mentioned Matt uses local  fresh ingredients ?We also had shared a sweet little glass of orange juice that tasted like you squeezed the juice 5 seconds ago . It hit the spot. \n\nService was well thought out and friendly. they could go crazy in that little  tiny busy  restaurant but the staff seemed to take all the happenings in stride.   Remember if you go ,put your name on the pad on the table out front as soon as you get there. If you have  a small party you might find a  place at the counter.  I 'd advise to be prepared to wait  but it's so worth it."	4
415	"Bad service. Mismarked boxes. Bought pecan halves there the other day. Opened the box and found pieces. Checked the labels to make sure it wasn't my error. \nReturned to store found all the boxes were mislabeled.\nTime spent driving and discussing well over 2 hours. The mgr offered no remedy just \""sorry.\"" \nQuestion: Do they really give a damn about quality and service?\nAnswer: Absolutely not. \nI don't want unreliability like this when trying to build my biz. I think I'll stick with Restaurant Depot."	0
416	Good portions. Service ok. Food quality questionable. Still a new location so maybe they'll get better?  Sort of expensive.	2
417	Food was amazing and deliscious. The salads were fresh and tasty and the black bean hummus was perfectly seasoned (not too garlicky but full of flavor). The butternut squash lasagna was perfect and flavorfull and so yummy. The carrot ginger risotto was cooked perfectly and the carrots, onions, and ginger added wonderful flavor. Nothing was oversalted. The food came quickly, was super fresh, hot, and portions were perfect. The server was very friendly. The outdoor patio was lovley and the decor was charming. Also the cookies were yummy!	4
418	Don't order the fish here, it's clearly frozen, not fresh. I've been to this restaurant several times with groups. While there's a decent drink/beer selection, it seems like most of the time alot of the food items on the menu are not available. The one thing I do love about this place is their sweet potato fries, which is topped with brown sugar. This is definately more of a bar + snacks kind of place and not so much a sit-down restaurant though they try. And as far as bars go, there are less expensive and better, elsewhere in town.	1
419	here at the resort's pool. asked my kids to look where we can get towels for there are a lot of entrances. my feet were sore from all the walking so i just told the kids to look where they can get towels. didn't find it but a staff passed by and he told us where it was. kids went and came back empty handed. they were told that you have to be 14 or a parent to get towels! \n\nwhat??? \n\nis there a written rule that says that? i haven't read it yet, i think. does that mean that it's the same in all the resorts? as a new timeshare owner, i'm wondering what i got myself into. now i've got to read the contract that i signed...\n\nthis stay is a freebie for attending the presentation. we were told that  this was located passed mandalay hotel. yup, it is about 6 miles or so after mandalay bay. well beyond the strip. now i'm wondering if all the properties are this way. the properties are big and the rooms are big too. but it's just that it's in the middle of nowhere. i'm thinking that when you're in vegas, you have  to be where the action is, which is the strip. \n\ni just hope that the other properties they have will be different. oh well, as i've said, i'm wondering what i got myself into...	0
420	In the past I've looked forward to even craved Pho Kim's fare.  Unfortunately, my recent visits have not delivered the consistent quality I've come to expect from this establishment.  I'm beginning to think this place is not what it once was.	1
421	I just had to drop a note to say just how nice it was to have fast, clear and strong Wi-Fi in my room.\nWhomever handles that for your place is doing great work.	3
422	"Just around the corner from my work, me and a few coworkers came looking for some play!  We went early and got a cush spot on the top floor with the window.  Clearly it's a hot spot in the neighborhood because it was packed by 7 pm on a Tuesday?!  The outside seating area was buzzing even in the chilly fall weather.  \n\nThe first quenching sip of that half-price RASPBERRY COSMO and I was sold!  Add on some true \""Pittsburgh\"" food (I'm talking about putting fries in a salad, oh yes!) and other yummy munchies like a super stuffed chicken quesadilla and our fun time was complete!"	3
423	Was here for a work dinner event.  Service was not good.  Very slow too.  Worst service I've gotten here.  Usually gotten better service.	2
424	I had been wanting to stay at the Sanctuary for a while now, and we decided on a quick 3 night vacation last week.  I must say we were extremely impressed with the resort, and cannot wait to go back!  The resort is a quiet paradise; it's in top-notch condition, with beautiful grounds, rooms, and amazing service.  The spa was a great experience; we both had reflexology treatments, and were able to spend time in the whirlpool and eucalyptus steam room as well.  The $ we spent on this vacation was well worth it!	4
425	I think this was probably the longest 65 minutes I've spent any any show.  Bite has moved to the Plaza and I had a free ticket last night so why not?  Well the long 65 minutes would be why not.\n\nThe show has been around for many years at the Stratosphere before moving to the Plaza so it's not jumping on the vampire movie craze that seems to have gripped the younger people.  \n\nI think the biggest problem is there really is no cohesive story and the show's writers don't know what kind of show they want other than topless (sometimes) female vampires doing different dances in different costumes in different amounts of dress/undress.  There are a couple of small magic tricks done by one of the male vampires and there were some strong man lifts and balances \u00e0 la Myst\u00e8re and the guys were OK.  But these disjointed segments of magic, dancing, strong man routines point out the unfocused nature of the show.  The showroom at the Plaza, which I think is a great classing Las Vegas room, is not designed for the types of things they used to do at the Strat.  There used to be some acrobatics done with silks, but that has to be dropped in this showroom.\n\nThe music was something else.  There was some 80s rock music and mixed in were two selections from opera that had almost no reason for being where they were.  Most of the music is recorded, but some was live and the singer was not too bad.\n\nAn acquaintance was seated at the same table as I was and his reaction was much the same as mine.  OK, I don't need to see this one again.  How this show continues to survive is completely beyond me.  The applause last night was not too great.  I have a feeling the show will soon bite the dust.	1
426	Free WiFi everywhere in the airport!\n\nCute rocking chairs in the main lobby. \n\nA few small shops.\n\nMostly fast food restaurants. The non-fast food restaurants are spread pretty far and wide. \n\nIt's a pretty good hike between concourses but there are walking sidewalks in places. \n\nOverall, it's an ok transfer point. Pack a lunch and sit a spell in the rocking chairs until your next flight.	2
427	"Except the tortilla soup which was excellent, everything else absolutely sucked!   As a person who appreciates and enjoys food and tries out new restaurants all the time specifically in Las Vegas, I am pretty surprised to see a restaurant in a great location and with a famous owner be so bad.\n\nThe medium filet minion was burned on the outside and dry like cotton on the inside.  The scallops were way too salty and dry as well.  The wild mushrooms and the Au Gratin potatoes were just terrible (more like Friday's).   I guess we should have known how the night was going to turn out after eating the tasteless bread and butter.  Perhaps they had the wrong people in the kitchen on a slow Tuesday night in Vegas because the restaurant was only a fifth full but the service was slooooow!  \n\nAnyway, they took the Fillet off the bill since we did not eat it but it stated on the bill that \""customer did not like\"".  I would be happy with that if I ate say an ethnic dish and I was not appreciative of the flavors or something like that.  But how the hell do you screw up a Filet Mignon in a steakhouse?  And then put it on the customer?  Really?\n\nHey Eva, at least take responsibility and add a line on the bill that says \""our food sucked\""!"	0
428	Items Selected:\nChocolate Chip Buttermilk Short Stack\nChallah French Toast\nBaked Apple Pancake\n\nTechnically a chain, with origins in Portland OR and the famous Walker Bros location in Wilmette IL, it was only when Groupon offered a discount that I realized Las Vegas even had an Original Pancake House and although I guess it could be said that the $8 discount was the impetus for my visit, in reality it was fond childhood memories that drew me through the doors.  Located on Fort Apache, and thus less than ten minutes from my door, it was after another long morning run that I arrived at the sizeable storefront and although the clock had just ticked past 7:15am I entered the restaurant to find the place already lively, a quartet of tables already seated while two couples before me checked in with a friendly hostess soon leading them to their seats.  Eventually finding my place at a booth best suited for four it was mere seconds before my server stopped by and with my order pre-decided based on past experience a simple request that plates arrive in two courses was granted, the long cooking time of the later assuring a fifteen minute delay between rounds.  Sipping on water as the restaurant continued to fill it would not be long before first plates arrived and although the restaurant's eponymous buttermilk batter was fluffy as ever beneath a mountain of whipped cream it was the house-baked challah that truly impressed, the exterior rendered crispy while the center was soaked in sweet custard playing counterpoint the rich egginess of soft bread.  Admittedly a substantial start, and nearly enough to use up my gift certificate, there was simply no way I was leaving Original Pancake House without ordering one of their signatures and this time opting for the Baked Apple Pancake over the Dutch Baby I'll simply say that one cannot go wrong with either, the piping hot pile of thinly sliced Granny Smith's teaming with cinnamon and sugar atop a buttery golden base proving as much a 'pie' as it does a pancake, but absolutely delicious regardless of what it is called.\n\nIndividually owned and operated but similar in menu from coast-to-coast there is simply 'something' about Original Pancake House that makes me smile - the service ever pleasant, the space always bustling, and the apple pancake always served so hot that you *know* the first bite is likely to end in a blistered mouth.  Obviously a bit more expensive than IHOP or Denny's but also using superior ingredients including 93-score butter, pure whipping cream, and free-range eggs it's good to know that every once in a while you can indeed find a taste of 'home,' even a thousand or more miles away.	3
429	If you're looking for pizza, this is not the spot. Too expensive for the ass tasting food. No nutrition and very not macro friendly. This place is shit.	0
430	My bf and I decided to take my cousin here for dinner per my cousin's request.  I wasn't sure what to expect but was very impressed by the service and food.  \n\nWe were served with this refreshing tea that was in an original looking jug.  The cups were made of some kind of silver metal and I think it was a bowl too.  Different.  Our server was very attentive and constantly came to our table to make sure we were okay and if we were ready to choose our dinner.\n\nWe finally chose and this was what we ended up with.\n1.)  Albap 8:  Kimchi, vegetables and fish roe on top of rice in a stone pot.  This was really good.  The fish roe gave it a good flavor.\n\n2.)  Ribs:  This was a little tough to eat.  I'm used to my ribs falling apart very easily.\n\n3.)  Chicken in hot sauce:  Too hot for my liking.  They said it wasn't too hot, but my pallet says otherwise.\n\n4.)  Side dishes with gaikon, asian broccolli, kimchi, beef, and I can't think of the names of the others.  But it was definitely a lot of side dishes on top of what we had ordered.\n\nOverall experience was top notch!	3
431	Yell at me, call me names, beat me up, just PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't make me go back to Saddle Ranch!!  Ick from beginning to end.  \n\nI made the mistake of bringing a couple out of town buyers here last night, a Monday mind you, thinking it would be fun and kitchy.  You know, they could watch a couple lushes get on the bull and made fools of themselves and fall off, rustic cowboy atmosphere, good enough for entertaining out of towners anyways.\n\nOh how wrong was I??  Just my luck it was their 1 year anniversary party and the placed was packed.  And packed with the worst kind of people.  It looked like a Real World casting call had thrown up all over the bar.  Skanky, underage girls literally falling over chairs, and being annoyingly in the way all the time.  Oh, and I'm pretty sure that all the steroids ever injected in AZ were in that bar too.  And get this, they were all wearing crystals on their shirts...puke.\n\nIt took FOREVER to get served at the bar which we obviously didn't stay at long because my clients wanted to get the hell out of there ASAP.\n\nThe only reason in gets any stars at all is because I cannot entirely turn my back on any place that serves cotton candy.  That would be the 5 year old in me : )	1
432	The good news is that they have kept their quality high and added gelato to the dessert buffet. I think there were six flavors. \n\nThe bad news is that their prices got a bit higher. Guess quality has to be paid for, does not come free. \n\nWill continue with the four star rating. I think Bellagio and Mandalay Bay are better values for the money.	3
433	"Service, food and experience were all fantastic!\n\nI enjoyed the Manhattan Clam Chowder with the Roast Beef Dip (French Dip with a side of Au Jus). Very filling.\n\nIf one of your dopey friends suggests \""let's go to the Carnegie deli because they have big sandwiches\"", punch them in the throat and tell them about Zoozacrackers.  There is a reason this one is rated higher."	3
434	I was in search of a particular rc plane that can only be found at Target within the store. It is not available online. I searched locations to find the remote control plane and drove to this location. Although, the online directory assured it was in stock at this store, I found it was not. I went to guest services to supply the DPC# and the clerk said there was definitely two in stock. When he called the clerk in electronics she confirmed it but would not bring the item to me. I was asked to walk back to the department that I had already searched to pick up the item. When I got there it was the same selection I had already viewed and was not the Jet Set 2 that I was looking for. The clerk informed me that it matched the DPC# that I brought in. I am very frustrated as this is the second store that I have gone to and was only referred to go to another store in Tempe! Too much running around and no definite answers! Feels like false advertisement to post an item only to find they do not carry it! My son will be very disappointed!	0
435	Had the biscuits special it was really good and a big portion of food. Ordered a side of sausage which I shouldn't have cause it was a lot of food. County style potatoes are the way to go!!! My lady had the eggs Benedict and it was alright little too buttery. Our daughter had the kids Mickey Mouse pancake it was big too and very good and fluffy. It's a little pricey but you do get what you pay for good food and large portion. Would go back again.	4
436	I don't have much to say about this hotel because I wouldn't stay here again.\n\nHotel rooms-I stayed in the back tower and the walk to the tower was horrible. Walking through an entire casino with your luggage is the biggest pain in the ass, not to mention walking the bridge across the pool to get to the tower. Big thumbs down. Room was really nice, decor was nice, beds comfy, but bathroom was a motel 6 bathroom. Very old looking. Not what I would expect if owned by a hilton chain.\n\nCasino-casino was actually nice and fresh. Because it was newly renovated it smelled clean and didn't smell like a shit hole like some of the older casinos. Lots of options.\n\nAccommodations-pool was awesome, staff is nice, house keeping staff nice, but check in was a nightmare. Checked in at 2pm and line stretched to the casino. I was in the hilton honors check in and that line was in the casino as well. If it takes 30 mins for checkin, then you have already lost me as a customer that will not stay there again.	2
437	Went out to try this place out today. Pulled the door handle and the door was locked. Peeked inside, the half of the ceiling lights were on and the tables were in dissaray and without a chair insite. More than likely this place went out of business.	0
438	"Score: 2.5  I don't think Mario Batali would be happy with our experience. The setting is gorgeous: a faux Piazza San Marco that is always sunny, but not hot, and only one well behaved pigeon. The cafe, itself is charming with faux outdoor seating and a magnificent refrigerated tower for cheese and salumi. If only the food and service matched this santized version of Venice, we would be singing its praises.\n\nThe service is the poster child for LVSS (Las Vegas Service Syndrome -- \""I will never see you again, so you are just an annoyance that must be dealt with\"" -- they do not rely upon regulars like most restaurants). The hostess exuded boredom as we approached her station. Our server was sluggish, coughed incessantly, was unfamiliar with the cheeses, and generally could care less. Being in the industry, we were appalled. We tried being extra nice, but no amount of warmth could encourage a glint of caring.\n\nThe food is pretty good. They use quality ingredients, but again, no one really cares or has passion for food. The pizza is OK, but not wood fired. The pasta (I had the bucatini) was good but nothing exciting. We ordered a portion of wine listed as 250ml which is about 8oz and it was not even close. This could be excusable if the prices were not so high.\n\nI do not suggest this place. Mario Batali has some fine restaurants, but this is not one of them."	1
439	To Owners, you should really consider covering the bright window so your first booth can be sat around 6!! We got the last booth avail and then saw 3 parties try to sit in the too much glare booth as they were warned by the hostess, and then upset that the only seating left was upstairs.  \n\nThe happy hour was good, I tried the house margarita, tinga taco, and an al pastor taco as well. I really didn't like how small the plate with the taco was, the tacos were almost falling off of the plate. I eat a lot of tacos at different restaurants and the entire experience was messed up because the 2 tacos were falling into each other on the really small plate. I liked the tinga taco but not the Al Pastor. \n\nMight come back for the atmosphere.	1
440	So sad to see one of my favorite places go down hill so quickly. First, they stopped serving dinners. Now, the service is horrible. We stopped in today for lunch at 12:30pm. It was very busy. My husband and I prefer a table and the hostess led us to a booth.  When we requested a table, she stated there were none available. We could see many tables available but were told that section was closed. Really, a closed section during the lunch rush? Not very smart management. We were told to wait. So we sat. After about 15 minutes, the hostess flipped the please wait to be seated sign to seat yourself and left. She said nothing to us about a table. We sat for another 5 minutes when more patrons entered and proceeded to seat themselves. Still nothing about a table for us.  We left and will not be back. It isn't surprising to me that they are losing business and having to cut their hours. I would complain about the service but there wasn't any!.	0
441	"What a cute store!  Bought my stroller here and it was the same price as it would have been from the manufacturer website minus the shipping and handling.  The owner was friendly and upbeat and gave me and my dad a great tutorial on how it works.  They also have all the accessories I will need in the future for my stroller and growing family.  Stop in here if you are expecting or know someone that is, you will be sure to find that perfect \""something\""."	4
442	Somebody dared me to check out this place in Madison on the topic of worse scummy bars in Wisconsin and this ranks among the top. My shoes became very sticky the moment walk gin this place and it took a while to get that stuff off my shoe. The smell of the place was atrocious and the place was disgusting everywhere and among the drunk quacks who hang out here. No college students in this bar this is a place for the seedier elements of Madison and it oth showed and smelled the night I visited here recently. A very scary bar	0
443	"Admittedly, Shauna and I were at Caffe Siena together for restaurant week and we usually have very similar opinions on food/service so I apologize for any overlap.  The quick and dirty review - food was exceptional, service was mediocre and the environment was uncomfortably warm and lackluster (though not terrible).  As my appetizer I ordered the baked eggplant - and wow - I almost wish I could have ordered it for dinner.  It was a generous portion stuffed with fresh mozzarella and a light tomato sauce.  I honestly thought nothing would outshine this starter but the sea bass was a flaky, tender and flavorful delight.  It was topped with thinly sliced vegetables and sat on a bed of potato gratin topped with a most delicious lobster sauce.  For dessert I tried to be \""good\"" and ordered the mango-berry sorbet.  I did indeed get sorbet. And it did indeed taste like mango-berry.  Not much more I can say on that.  \n\nAs for the service, our waiter was very sweet but the timing of our experience was not very good.  Our reservation was for 8 PM and we didn't leave the restaurant until nearly 10 PM.  We also sat with finished entree plates for a notable length of time.  \n\nPerhaps my biggest complaint was the temperature.  If you have not been to Caffe Siena before, the kitchen is viewable from the restaurant.  It's a large cut-out in the wall and the prepared food is actually placed on a visible counter for the servers to pick up.  Now anytime you decide to combine the kitchen and the dining room it's super important that the heat coming off the kitchen is tempered by a solid A/C system.  I'm not sure what was going on but the front door of the restaurant was propped open, the ovens were going full force and by the end of dinner some of us were sweating. The smell that came out of the kitchen also permeated into the dining room so it smelled like I was standing over the frying pan for most of the night.  My clothes also smelled after leaving. If you've ever worked for a restaurant before, you'll know what I'm talking about!\n\nIf Caffe Siena could match their ambiance and service to their food, I'd be a recurring customer - no doubt."	2
444	Love this place. Good happy hour specials. Food is consistently great!	3
445	WAIT WAIT WAIT.......... 5 stars for food and beer only @ the BBQ restaurant next to the brewery...\n\nOK, Ellis Island is a dump of a casino, it looks old but it has three things going for it...........BBQ baby back ribs, BBQ chicken and onsite brewed beer. They cook the ribs in the parking lot as you enter from Koval.\n\nThey brew their own (multiple beers). $1.75 for an 20 ounce glass...... And they make (non alcoholic) root beer too............... I'm hooked on the lite beer.\n\nOK, here is my humble opinion. I can drop a $100+ bucks easily on myself for dinner at the right place 7 days a week if I wanted to. I just wanted to be clear that I'm not cheap.\n\nEllis Island was mentioned to me about two years ago and I finally went in June 2011. I'm not a fan of BBQ because I don't like the mess and usually the lack of meat on the rib bones. You WON'T have that problem here. For $13, you can get at least an 18 inch+ rack of baby backs, (BBQ beans, slaw, bread and corn on the cob very average). You can also get a rib/chicken combo. There is a pizza place within spitting distance that serves great pizza by the slice that you can bring to the table (our appetizer).\n\nI CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK........... And I'll get two racks of ribs next time because they were that damn good and cheap.\n\nBEWARE, IT'S POPULAR, SMALL AND THERE WILL BE A WAIT. SO DRINK UP!!!!\n\nFYI, It's behind Bally's to the east.	4
446	Our kids LOVE this water park.  We have enjoyed it during the summer (the outside park is great) and winter for just the inside park.  The water is a bit chilly though, and our youngest one shivers the entire time.  Wish they could raise the water temp a bit especially in the winter.   As far as staying at the hotel, that was just okay.  We spent money on the wand things (for get the name of it) and that was a complete waste.  The food is very pricey, so is the buildabear area and gaming area.  Can easily drop hundreds of dollars in two days.  So, it's worth the stay for the water area but we will skip the extras in the hotel next time.	3
447	The ambiance was amazing, the sparkling wine upon entry is a great touch, and the service was decent (although a bit young and inexperienced overall).\n\nSo with all the highlights out of the way, let's get on to my problem with the Wrigley Mansion.  The food was overall good, but not exquisite.  Of the four dishes that we tried, I would have thought we selected from the menu of a $15 per plate neighborhood restaurant, not a $25+ fine dining destination.\n\nThen I ordered the wine, 2004 Rombauer Merlot, a very familiar vintage for me.  It was bad.  Next glass, different bottle, also bad (can't remember what it was, though).  I ended up with a glass of the house wine.  Bad wine is unacceptable for any restaurant, especially when wine can play such an important role in the meal.\n\nDessert was great, but I only know because I stole a bite from Catherine's plate.  I'm just not a desert guy.\n\nOverall, I would say that yes I will go back as soon as they lower prices and downgrade the ambiance to be more casual, or fix the problems.  Until then, I can think of several better values for fine dining, mostly in the very same area where Wrigley Mansion competes for business.	1
448	It's a Roberto's. I used to be in love with the food here. Over the years that has faded. I also think the overall quality of food has as well. There are several locations all over Vegas. I do think Roberto's is better than a lot of spots you can eat. But after trips to mexico and a few out of this world food truck street tacos robertos is just average. It is average that I like to eat from time to time if I am craving it. I like it, I used to love it. It's still good just not great in my books.	2
449	Not so good! I had the aligator and crawfish combo. Both were way over cooked and very tough. The breading was too heavy and didn't have any flavor.	0
450	I was really disappointed all around with our visit to the cupcakery this afternoon. On top of spending over 3$ PER cupcake the service there was less that stellar. In fact..it was plain terrible. They may be the only game in town @ the moment but that's not going to last forever & people are going to remember the way they were treated when a new place sets up shop. I was very disappointed in the fact that they have these flavors that sound fun & yummy but don't allow you to taste them. They make it a point that there are NO REFUNDS as you see signs plastered from wall to wall highlighted making sure you know that not for any reason (whether you like the cupcake or not) will they refund your outrageous 3$ cupcake. Still, I went against my better judgement & my husband & I each ordered one for ourselves & one for our toddler son. It was also upsetting to see her cram 3 entirely different flavored cupcakes (Banana, Choc peanut butter & Strawberry shortcake) inside of a small plastic container then closing the lid smooshing them all together &  the frosting smashed against the sides & top of the plastic to go box. Over 9$ for 3 cupcakes to have them smashed into a box... The icing on the cake (no pun intended) was that the Strawberry Shortcake cupcake was awful. It had a terrible artificial strawberry taste & was so dry & insanely dense. So there was 3$...down the drain. Which could have been avoided if she would have let us sample before buying. In all honest, if I had sampled one before buying any, I would not have purchased (or even sampled)anything at all. We haven't even eaten the other 2, they are still smashed together inside of the to go box on the counter. What a terrible experience to drive in from boulder city for. Neither us, nor our friends & family will ever visit this place again.	0
451	Finally tried Sucker Punch Sally's today and I think it has promise.  They are still on the small opening menu so the lunch choices were limited but I had the pork tenderloin sandwich and must say I was impressed.  Obviously made in house and not frozen, nice sized portion and very tasty, almost like a German schnitzel.  The fries were so-so, I don't care much for fresh cut fries as they are usually limp like these were.  Will definitely give them another try for breakfast and when they get the full menu going in a few weeks.  Nice vibe and the waitress was very friendly.  If you live in the area and have been thinking about it, give them a try.	2
452	"I had high hopes for eat. based on all the reviews I had read of their breakfast, but they were sadly dashed one by one throughout the course of my meal. The hopes were mostly kind of silly (looking for a live DJ! Wanting to drink a mimosa!), but some of them were just basics of eating out (having a server who didn't treat me like serving me was the last thing they wish they were doing, bringing maple syrup with pancakes) and those were kind of a big deal.\n\nI know that sometimes I like to order odd things. In the case of eat. I ordered a pancakes based \""meal\"" and a side of grits. I asked to switch bacon for sausage. I don't know if that's considered a big deal in some areas, but I've never thought it to be a huge thing in the past. Then my husband ordered. Then the waitress said to our table, \""guys orders are always so much easier than girls.\"" Wha??? I think she was just talking smack about me to my face and to our whole table because I asked to switch sausage for bacon? That alone would have been enough to make me feel uneasy with my meal, but the rest of the meal kind of went along the same route - taking a long time for refills of coffee or water, not bringing any syrup with pancakes and not checking in on us for long enough we had to flag someone else down who did bring us the syrup so I could eat my lukewarm meal.\n\nAnyway, the pancakes were actually really, really good. The other food was average. But, none of it was worth feeling like I was a hassle for trying to eat breakfast there."	2
453	Decent grub, although the grape leaves sucked and the service, while quick, was RUDE. No atmosphere. Much better Med food in the 'burgh.	1
454	No, No, No.\nI was expecting far better. While the service was better than the meal, I must say all I was, was disappointed. Tinoco's has become similar to a diner, with better than the average diner's pasta.	1
455	Place is small the staff is rude. Pool is dirty. Lol and was on a waiting list for an iron that I never got. Place sucks	0
456	The owners of one of Munich's most famous institutions, the historic Hofbrauhaus, have lovingly recreated it - across from the Hard Rock Hotel - down to the last detail, complete with beers, steins, and brass bands. Stepping through the front door, you leave behind the arid desert air and glitzy casinos of Vegas as you're transported into a world of schnitzel, ale, and strudel, served in a beer hall with ornately painted columns and ceilings, or an indoor garden with chestnut trees and a fountain, by buxom dirndl-clad waitresses with rosy cheeks. Having been to the original, I can attest to the autheniticy of the look, the feel, and the extensive Bavarian menu here. Liver mousse is served with a pretzel baked with dough flown in from the fatherland on a daily basis. If you like sausage, you must indulge in a wurstplatte, overloaded with Viennese franks, chicken and pork links, creamy mashed potatoes, and imported sauerkraut. Pork roast with dark beer sauce and bread dumplings, fried filet of cod with warm German potato salad, and breaded pork cutlet with cranberries are among the other specialties. Three versions of hofbrau - lager, a premium dark wheat, and a seasonal version - are on tap, and German, Australian, and California wines are available by the bottle or glass. Naturally the atmosphere is loud and festive, as if it's Oktoberfest every day of the year. If you're not part of a group, you probably will be before the night is over. As highly recommended as it is totally unexpected for Vegas.	4
457	Had to go in when I saw the sign. Didn't expect to buy anything, but I found a cool zombie Hello Kitty shirt for my daughter. It's a little too big, but maybe after it gets washed a couple of times, she can wear it to kindergarten.	3
458	She has fixed more than hand full of suits for me (blazers & pants) and she's really really good.. and the prices are less than half of what I was quoted at another shop on Spring Mountain and Ft. Apache. She fixed a $1000 tuxedo that was ruined by someone else by cutting it too short. She found the right material and fixed it for $20. \nShe's old school.. honest and straight forward. Don't expect BS and fake smiles..	4
459	Awesome, authentic Mexican cuisine.  Great service and $1 beers, what could be better.	3
460	"If you live in vegas, the best place to shop is NOT the forum shops. Sure they have an Apple Store, but there is another one, not too far away at Town Center, that has a friendlier staff. This whole mall is just a big tourist trap.\nFirst you go in, depending on where you enter at, and it feels like you are being herded around like a flock of sheep. You literally have one of two directions you can go, forward or backwards. There is no way to get from one store to another, unless you pass every store between to get to it, unlike a regular mall which has \""branches\"" of hallways or interconnection hallways that run parallel to one another.\nOn top of that, the prices here are RIDICULOUS. Who can justify paying $12 for coffe, when at most, when you hit Starbuck, you are looking at $5. And not even gourmet coffee, crap coffee. Even the Apple Store has higher prices here, for the same computer you can get 4 miles away. Don't even get me started on clothing. If you really want to spend.... your life's savings, on your next shirt, go for it. More power to you. I mean I make a decent pay, but this whole place is a joke when it comes to pricing. \nThe only saving grace about this whole place is the cool statue guys that stand still for hours on end for tips. You can literally fake punch them, tell them jokes, dance in front of them, fake fall in front of them, and they won't move. They are great. Besides that this place is basically just another location for tourists to throw money away."	1
461	this is easily my favourite place to eat in montreal, let alone the best thai i've ever had. everytime i order a veggie pad thai elsewhere, i constantly compare it to bangkok and how i'd just rather be sitting in that depressing foodcourt.	4
462	Treasure Island wasn't as bad as I expected it to be from all the reviews. \n\nMe and my boyfriend ending up staying here because it was the cheapest hotel for the weekend. We spent about $260 for 3 days and 2 nights, thats including the resort fee. The room and bathrooms were nice and spacious. The beds were super comfy and the pillows felt like clouds. \n\nMy only complaint was that the cleaning person did not come and fix the room. We left early Saturday morning and came back in the afternoon thinking we were gone long enough for our room to be cleaned and it wasn't.\n\nOverall our stay was nice. Check in was fast, but that was probably because we came around 8pm on Friday. Check out was easy, we just did it from our TV in the room and dropped the keys in the drop box by the elevators on the first floor.	3
463	The premier buffet for its selection of food, food quality and table service!\n\nThe grill prepares the meats for a variety of tastes including steaks. The meat selections include all forms of ethnicities including Asian chicken and pork dishes, Mexican entrees and sides, and Italian lasagna and various pastas. The fruits and vegetables are fresh and restocked by several people stocking & serving the bar, and hot sides include all the steamed varieties. Breads, rolls and muffins are plenteous, as are the melons and fruit spread across the bars at the salads, entrees and desserts. \n\nThe servers are customer oriented and are always ready and willing to assist, and will even chirp-out a Happy Birthday or two! But wait, there's more! \n\nThe dessert bar has the famous chocolate fountain replete with an endless variety of items to dip including fruit and specialty items designed for smothering in chocolate. All of this for $12.99 per adult! This is by far the freshest and best buffet in the west. \n\nThe wait is well worth it and attests to the desirability of the food and service. People go where people are, and it's becoming the place for buffeteers!\n\nYou won't leave hungry, guaranteed!	3
464	Not a good weekend for dining out, I guess.... Stopped at Byrd's for drinks after work on Friday - here's our take on it.\n\nThe place is confusing, and it would seem as though the staff is quite confused as well.  We walked in and stood at the bar for a few minutes - we weren't sure how to go about scoring an outdoor table, so we thought it best to ask.  \n\nUnfortunately, no one stopped to help us; the bartender stood on the opposite end of the bar, talking to folks.  Waitresses zipped past us without a word.  We went upstairs to check on things ourselves and it still wasn't clear if we could just grab a table.  So it was back downstairs where we flagged down a manager who told us we could seat ourselves.  Whew.\n\nSat at a table outside for a bit before a waitress stopped by to see if we needed anything.  We asked about drink specials - she wasn't sure if there were any; perhaps tap beers were $1 off?  \n\nWe ordered a few beers.  And waited.  And waited some more.  And then we switched tables (the shade looked more inviting).  And then our beers came out and the waitress was gone.  We flagged her down for the check and waited some more.  And then we left.  \n\nDisorganized for sure.  Drinks were reasonably priced, but that's about the only positive to share.  Unlikely that we'll go back.  :-(	1
465	My daughter and I had food delivered yesterday. O my goodness everything we ordered came hot and freshly prepared. My favorite was the Crab Puffs and the Sweet and Sour Chicken. My daughter loved her Fried Shrimp and Sweet and Sour Chicken. The portions were big enough that we shared with my 2 boys when they got home. I had the Combination Dinner, it was a lot of food. My daughter had Chicken, Rice, and Shrimp. Will definitely be ordering front them again. Also they were very friendly. Even answered questions we had about a different dish.	4
466	Drove by the other day, and it has a new name and a sign looking for employees. Looks like it's no longer Dragon :(	0
467	Something new to do in Vegas for the regular visitors. They give club card discounts do be sure to bring your card. Very high up and you can't bring anything with you. Super friendly staff and amazing views. Wasn't scary as long as you don't have a fear of heights as it doesn't go very fast. Glad that I did it but wish I would have done it at night.	2
468	The food/drinks first...\n\n- I ordered off the pork belly and the hamburger off the happy hour menu.  Both were good.  That being said I'm one of those people who just doesn't get what the big deal is about pork belly (not here specifically, just in general).  As noted, it was good but I wouldn't get overly excited about it.\n\n- Ordered the BBQ chips off the regular menu.  Good but the BBQ they put on the chips is rather spicy and really sticks to your fingers.  You will most definitely have to wash your hands after eating theses.\n\n- Ordered two sangrias.  They were ok.\n\nThe restaurant...\n\n- It was warm.  Either the a/c doesn't work or they just don't turn it down.  Either way, it was warm.  Oddly, for I while I thought they may have been running a swamp cooler.  Not sure, but for part of the time it certainly felt that way.\n\n- Service...good but sllllllloooooooowwwwwww.  About 10 minutes to get someone to the table.  About 10 minutes to get a drink.  Had to ask for the soda I ordered twice.  It showed after being there for more than 20+ minutes.  The place wasn't crowded so I don't know what the deal was with getting things out.\n\nI might go back just to see if I was there on an off day/night but otherwise nothing here blew my dress up enough to be in a rush.\n\nProbably a 2.5 but I'll give them a 3 for now.	2
469	Awesome cubano sandwich. Great decor and feeling. Its a mim and pop place.. Definately going back.. Its a must..	4
470	By far the worst sushi restaurant in town. I have been there 3 times, to be fair and give it a chance to change my mind. Each time the sushi has been dull, flavorless, and completely over priced. The service is so-so, and the menu would be impressive it the sushi had any quality to it at all. I have eaten many types of  good sushi and have never been so disappointed by the quality of food. For $14.00 I expect far more than some stale crab, limp rice, and over salted dipping sauce. Unfortunately, there are far better sushi places in town, such as Stingray and Kobe Tepan. Don't waste your time or money on Sushi 101	0
471	That place is horrible. We never get served and we got ignored from servers and bartender. They did not bring the  menus and didn't even ask us for drinks  for about 10 mins. So we just walked out. Again, that's terrible place to go.	0
472	I am giving this place two stars because the tacos are good. The service, on the other hand is terrible. Please hire more people. It took an hour for an order of two tacos to arrive at my table. Yes, it was a busy night but COME ON it's tacos! Most of the things that go in it are already prepared. You will not get my money again Ta Chido...and I like tacos ALOT.	1
473	Chips and salsa are amazing. Food is good. Fresh. Was disappointed to recieve fish tacos with fried fish in a restaurant of this caliber.	2
474	We were in China Town Plaza wanting to grab a quick lunch but our little one wanted noodles. It was between this place and Harbor Palace.\n\nWe ordered the wonton noodles and dry beef chow fun.\nThe dishes were your typical decent Chinese food but I felt it wasn't worth the price we paid. Pretty much all the dishes here were overpriced and they didn't even have some sort of lunch menu/specials. \n\nI have to admit, the service was pretty decent but I think we'll stick to our usual Chinese restaurant, KJ Kitchen. \n\nP.S. Most of the restaurant near China Town areas are CASH ONLY. So, be sure to bring some cash...	2
475	I'm torn between the quality product and the poor service and WiFi.  \n\nThe coffee is exceptional but the entry fee (getting past the flaming hoops of attitude) to get your coffee is a little high.  Now I guess I'm one of the cool kids at times (working for the man - Buring Man), but unless that comes up in conversation, most often I'm not dressed the part in my business casual and just another target for the staff.\n\nBeyond the slow service and attitude, the WiFi is crap.  They are riding a signal from a neighbor companies (Wet Paint) router.  I wish they'd get their own router and Cox connection!  Hell I'd even set it up for them, and when I suggested putting a WiFi tip jar the customers at the bar were all for it!\n\nI like the location and the product but not the service and WiFi - both things that can be fixed.	1
476	First time in Phoenix and read the reviews on Yelp. I'm glad to pick this place and the employees are very friendly (Deaf Friendly too). I had Veronica as my stylist, she did an amazing job with my hair. Veronica understood exactly what I wanted and double checked with me to make sure what I wanted. Veronica did an excellent job with undercut and quiff style. I do recommend her (even she is so nice lady and cute too:\nShe work from Tuesday through Saturday)\n\nAs for interior, it's cute and rock looking salon. Very cute and simple, easy to relaxing while get hair done.\n\nI spent about $35 for cut and shampoo/conditioner plus tip too. I believe is the price is just right for me and felt it's worth it.	4
477	"First of all, I wouldn't really consider this an \""attraction\"" its more of a \""curiosity\"".\n If you find yourself in the general area and you have 15 minutes to kill, stop by.  Otherwise you're going out of your way to see  a few lions sleeping. \nI admit, lions are not something you see every day and the opportunity to see even one (despite the fact that it's sleeping) is fairly awesome. But you arrive, wait patiently for a spot close to the glass to catch a glimpse of one, take a photo and then you just kind of stand there. And then after a minute of that you start think \""Wow, these are seriously beautiful creatures. It sucks that they're stuck in this artificial environment getting gawked at all day.\""  I felt a little dirty afterwards. \nI will say the habitat itself is beautiful! 9 million dollars worth of beautiful.\nThere's also an informative recording that plays every 5-10 minutes. It tells you about the habitat, the lions and gives helpful factoids. One of which was: Lions sleep 18-20 hours a day. They are not dancing monkeys. \n\nTo view the exhibit itself is free, but if you wanna shell out $25 bucks you and one other person can get your photo taken with a lion cub. \nI'm not gonna lie. They were reeeaaalllyyy f***ing cute!"	1
478	Another run-of-the mill Americanized Thai restaurant that seems to be the norm around AZ.  Rubbery meats, American broccoli, boring carrots and zucchini. No spice factor, few herbs and fish sauces, no authentic dishes, or dishes done authentically. Where's the roasted duck red curry, larb salads, Asian/Thai vegetables, whole-fried fish, papaya salad with blue crab? Oh, I forgot I'm in Central Phoenix. Geeze, I'm such a food snob. If ya'll think this is good, your mouth will MELT when you get the real stuff.  On the plus side, it's a nice, small restaurant and was very busy at lunch. To-go orders don't get the house salad they serve but you do get a little eggroll wrapped in foil.\n\nMy search for  true Phoenician Thai food with bold, complex flavors continues.  Any leads would be greatly appreciated.	1
479	"e2 emeril's eatery- I soooo wanted this to be the meal of my life or at least the MOTY. It wasn't the meal of the week, but I'll be back and here's why...\n\nAesthetics- The dining room is colorful and fun, the bar is very well integrated into the restaurant and the tables are very well spaced. I love being able to look into the kitchen and the wine cellar. The staff wears plaid shirts and jeans and I think this is another case of a restaurant having high class menu items and $30+ entrees and foodie selections, yet needing to say \""We're Casual. See look at how our staff dresses! Yep, we're casual\"". I didn't wear jeans because I was excited about having a nice dinner date, yet the staff was wearing jeans so maybe they just didn't want to impress me. There is a noise that permeates the dining room that sounds like a factory- it might have been the hood fans in the kitchen. It wasn't overbearing, just there hanging out with me and my lovely date. \n\nMenus- The dinner menu got me really fired up! There were at least four appetizers I wanted to order and one appetizer special that had me salivating (steak carpaccio with arugula). \nThe beverage program is also is very exciting. While there are very few old world red wines on the list- with very flavorful food like this, old world reds might have been overpowered. The selections on the wine list are fun and they cover a lot of different styles (South African sweet Shiraz anyone or Kung Fu Girl Riesling?). The cocktail list was also really exciting and our server recommended the bourbon and maple syrup drink to go with the lamb ribs, awesome idea! It takes enthusiasm, creativity and execution for a server to be so engaged that he/ she will recommend a liquor drink or beer with an entr\u00e9e. They also have local beer, fun wines by the glass and a lively bar. \n\nExecution- Service was good. We had our bread and butter plates removed before entrees, food was served over the right shoulder at other tables and  I was offered a black napkin (instead of just switching my napkins out), but aside from those tiny details it was perfect service. The water service, silverware replacement and overall attention and knowledge was spot on.\nCeviche Avelar- delicious salmon ceviche, small portion. Very refreshing and light. $9\nRoasted Baby Octopus- chewy octopus, crunchy chickpeas, great smoky flavor $9\nLamb Ribs- I still haven't made up my mind if I liked this or not, so I'll just say the lamb wasn't overpowered by the tangy tomato based barbecue sauce. $12\nCitrus Tea Lacquered Five Day Duck- very moist, and slightly chewy duck meat with a very delicate anise flavor. The veggies and faro were delicious. $30\nHerb Roasted Ashley Farms Chicken- Delicious, delicious, delicious! With a very delicate herbaceous flavor, very tender meat and enough leftover for lunch today, this was the plate of the night $22\nThe key to this meal was the depth of flavors. Everything had complex flavors, but more importantly had layers of flavors that built up as you worked through the plate. For example, the anise/ licorice flavor in the meat of the duck lead directly into the natural, earthy, grain flavor of the farro. It made the dishes seem very thoughtful and interesting.\nNeedless to say we didn't have room for dessert. That is the number two reason to return. Number one? There were a lot of exciting items on the menu that I still want to try! I really want to taste the Bone Marrow appetizer, the \""Ham Cured\"" Pork Loin, The Confit of Pork Cheeks, the Hamachi Crudo...dammit, now I am hungry again!"	3
480	My shopping experience was great minus the fact that they sold me a shoe with a hole in it. No returns, perfect but at least exchange the shoe with a hole. The manager was rude and made no effort to make me happy. She also accused me of wearing the shoe...yes I did in my house when I noticed the hole. I tried to exchange (not return)the shoe the following day. Not shopping here again. I'm all about customer service and yours was shitty.	0
481	3.5 *\n-Located in the Venetian; smaller than I though it was\n-Waited about 15-20 minutes in line\n-Got a table with 2 bottles away from the dance floor which I think was the best option\n-Dance floor hella packed but alot of energy and extras\n-Table service was good - shout out to our waitress Jennifer who was on point\n-Mens bathroom with a line all night but not too bad\n-Good ratio for all u singles out there\n-Good music\n-Other than my friend I had to carry out and take back to the hotel, it was a good night	2
482	"Let me begin by saying I got a yelp account specifically to give this restaurant one star. First of all the prices are unbelievably high. Now that in itself doesn't completely turn me away, however I do expect top notch quality and service if I'm going to pay 144 dollars for a steak. This was far from the case. The waiter did not seem knowledgable in steaks aside from how to steer you away from the reasonably priced filet mignon. \n\nThe ribeye for two that me and my brother shared came out freezing cold and extremely undercooked. Not only that but the meat was chewy and some pieces were down right not edible. \""The best steak in Las Vegas\""? I think not!\n\nMy recommendation, go to Ruth's Chris in harrah's and get a 50 dollar steak that won't disappoint."	0
483	I was definitely apprehensive about going here for lunch.  After all, crepes are for breakfast or dessert.  However, after reading some of the reviews I had to try it, well because I like food that is different.\n\nThe decor/atmosphere was pretty casual.  The service was a bit slow despite the fact that there weren't that many people there.  However, the food was excellent!  I have been there a couple times now and had the Queen City crepe and the special with sausage/red pepper.  It was all very good. \n\nI also made a mistake of ordering a dessert wrap with the mistaken belief I would be able to eat that with lunch.  Well, I did eat it, it was excellent, and I suffered for the rest of the day.\n\nOverall, the only reason I knocked it down a star is because the service has been slow every time I have gone.  Otherwise, if you are looking for great food in NoDa, I would definitely recommend this place!	3
484	"Five stars for the OMG AMAZING superfood salad (super is right)!!!  I hope they never, ever take this off the menu...not even in a zillion years.  It's just so lovely and exactly what I have been missing at nearly every other restaurant in the UK.  People often ask me what I miss about home (US) and the only thing I say without hesitation is, \""the entree salad.\""  Why is it so rare here to find a salad that is not only big enough to constitute an entire meal, but is also GOOD?  Well here at Pizza Express, of all places, I have finally found it.  This was my first time ever in a Pizza Express.  There's apparently one in George Square, but I've been spending all my culinary energy in that part of town at Pintos...not any more I won't!\n\nThree stars for the ho-hum service.  Nothing remarkably bad about the service, but certainly nothing stand-out amazing.  So four stars it is for Pizza Express - imagine my surprise!"	3
485	This is one of the first noodle joints I had tried in Charlotte and have stuck with since the opening of many more around the area. \n\nI'll keep my review to the point. It has noodles from the major regions of the world and you choose the meat or veggie that you want. This location is a fairly decent size, but I wouldn't imagine bringing a huge group inside. \n\nThe food I always end up getting is of good quality and freshness. I've never had a bad experience here, hence, the reason why I keep coming back. Their udon noodle and pad thai isn't too bad if you're looking for a quick fix, but not the best for sure. Fairly decent pricing, depending on what meat you usually get. Waiting staff is courteous and prompt and always willing to make things right.	3
486	I am not a museum person at all.  But after I met my husband who enjoys mob movies, I planned a mob-themed Valentine's Day for us last year.  The Mob Museum was a must on the agenda.\n\nThis is one of my favorite museums. It is dense with lots of information, confiscated property, and FBI collections. I don't think I even got through the last floor after being there for 4 hours!  My favorite exhibits contained videos, photographs, and props. I especially enjoyed the video near the exit that talked about who the mob movies were inspired by.  I also enjoyed the 2nd floor with the courtroom where the Kefauver hearings were held.  Another is the JFK Assassination room.  Oh and the film about the gruesome murders.  Murder Inc. There's so much to see!\n\nDefinitely one of a kind, fun, intense, and eye-opening.  So fun that I became a member!  Please visit and support the mob museum. I want this part of American history to be preserved as long as we can!	4
487	We recently stayed there as a large group for our wedding. All of our guests loved the atmosphere and there stay. I was very impressed with the staff and the service we received the entire weekend. From the beginning with the planning with there corporate members for a Large room block, to booking a shuttle,  to checking in and out they where amazing. I also recommend the spa , Karen was my therapist and I can say it was one of the best massages I have ever had.  Perfect location especially for our out of town people and over all a great stay!	4
488	I really liked this place, but we were guests of my in-laws, and they got us the adjoining room, so note: we didn't have to sit through any time share sales pitch or had to even fend anyone off trying to sell us the timeshare. (BTW... we have one and wouldn't get another one anyways, I can't manage them all in my head and they give me a headache trying to!)\n\nI digress... anyways, as far as this Bluegreen place is concerned, I was concerned at first about the lowflying aircraft seemingly overhead on the east side of the building, but upon arrival in to our room, didn't notice any aircraft noise at all. The limited interaction we had with the staff was pleasant, and I didn't feel like I was being sold anything. (And when we checked in, they knew we were guests) aka- fresh meat.\n\nLiked that there were restaurants attached to the place- favorite- Einstein Bros. Bagels. Yum, busy place in the morning though! Note to self... they had awesome service there too. Friendly staff and great menu and deals.  ABC Store as well! Just like in the Islands.. Even smelled like the Islands. (Prob. that Plumeria perfume in it!)  Pizza place and a burger place too, didn't have time to go there though.\n\nTHe only downside I can say that I noticed first hand is that if you are adverse to walking, request a room not so far from the lobby. The elevator, seriously is like a HIKE to get to, and not near the main lobby at all. \n\nI did like that it's non-smoking and off the strip, and good parking that is near the lobby. (Remember my tip about the elevator though!)	3
489	"Great UYE here last week.  Friendly staff, but missed some very important details when describing the appetizers to our large group.  We were brought 4 platters at $24.95 each.\n\n----NO BOOZE!!!    ----NO BYOB!!! \n\nSo the \""value\"" part of this restaurant totally sucks.   My combination of the pork something and the mole, which were good but not great, were incredibly small portions for $17.95.  I seriously did not have enough meat in the mole sauce for a single taco. Weak. Beans were average. Rice was tasty, but like another reviewer said I think they used frozen vegetables.\n\nI think the Guacamole was $10.95!\n\nIt's kinda a nice place, but the prices are easily 2 to 3 time higher than what they should be.   I'll go to Barrio Cafe and not this place from now on."	1
490	My husband and I were eating this food back when it was just Pittsburgh Willy's at the antique market! We love it! The food is simple, often something we coI'll and would make at home, but that is why it is good. It is home cooking that you don't have to make yourself! I was pleasantly surprised this morning when I found out that they have a breakfast menu!  I had the fried bologna sandwich, which was made with a thick slab! It was very good. My husband had a cheesy mess of breakfast tasty! And these were big plates of food!\n\nAbout the service. The food comes out much faster now-a-days, which is probably because they have a bigger area to work in, and I am so excited for them! The food is hot and fresh. The owner, Randy, is the first face I have always seen, even back at the antique market, and he seems so stoked to have customers. Such a good atmosphere at this legitimate mom'n'pop shop.\n\nCheck them out!	4
491	The sushi here is always fresh and delicious.  Not crazy about there entries. There spicy tuna roll is jam packed with tasty tuna. Very good sushi bar.	3
492	Got the portabello burger with a side salad and it was so so good. Everything on the menu sounds great. The employees were super nice. Can't wait to come back!	4
493	"Welcome to an excellent case study in why a nice property in a desirable, high-traffic location would be more than half empty during dinner.  Exhibit A: Three empty-headed hostesses so busy bantering wittily with themselves that it took them over two minutes to acknowledge my existence.  Exhibit B: I ordered a glass of Pinot and it tasted like it had been opened sometime during prior year.  I mentioned to bartender who said \""no, I just opened it\"" rather than offering a replacement.  And what a Happy Hour: $1 off -- can they spare it?  Dinner portions were excellent, but food was mediocre, other than the super croissants: warm and delicious, but nowhere near enough to make up for the rest of the experience.  With so many other superb options in Scottsdale, I can't see this place lasting another year.  Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere."	1
494	I have now dined at Central bistro 2 times for the Brunch menu on the weekends and 4 times for dinner in the evening. Every time I have gone in I always try something different off the menu. First off, the restaurant has a beautifully open layout concept from the high ceilings to the marble tables throughout. The hostesses always greet you professionally. I have had up to 4 different servers here and they definitely know their info on the menu items and the cocktails. one of the most in depth cocktail was their lemoncello sour, a spin off on the whiskey sour and the server even went into detail about how the chef prepares the lemoncello he also brought out a few extra italian black cherries that are garnished with the drink and showed us this 80$ jar of cherries. I absolutely LOVE their Brunch menu most off all because i am a brunch fanatic. The eggs Benedict and the Chicken n Waffles are all to DIE FOR. I Highly recommend this restaurant if you want a beautiful place to hang out with excellent service and food.	4
495	"Closed on Monday's? And closed 5/30 to 6/1? Wow. The prices on the menu don't seem that bad. But i still cant get over the fact there closed on Mondays. There is a sign posted \""help wanted\"" so if anyone reads this and needs a job check this place out. And tell them to open on Mondays. BOOOOO, if they weren't closed I would have never found Square Cafe."	0
496	My fianc\u00e9 and I were walking down the strip with my sister and decided to get a drink. We passed this place and I decided I wanted to try it because of the fire on the tables. Yeah, that was a deciding factor for me lol. My fianc\u00e9 got an adios mother fuc*er and my sister and I got a strawberry daiquiri. My fianc\u00e9s drink was strong and well work the money while my sister and I's drinks were just overpriced slushies. Pretty disappointing since it was my sister's first drink ever and because I can get buzzed off of an 8oz. glass of wine. My fianc\u00e9 even asked the waitress if there was any alcohol or if it was a virgin. According to her, it had 10%, same as a beer. I get buzzed off of a beer so they must have forgotten to put the alcohol in. Pretty disappointing. We won't be returning unfortunately.	1
497	I guess this place is good value because you receive a ton of really terrible food with terrible service at a cheap price.  The food is always cold, the sides are terrible (except for the coleslaw), and the service is terrible - whenever I have gone it is like a bunch of high schoolers are running the place.  Last time I went half the tables weren't cleared,  there was no cutlery to eat with and I had to ask for it 6 times and wait 5 minutes to get anything, and after I did I had a door slammed in my face.   A friend of mine said it was worse that a school cafeteria - I would have to agree.	0
498	I know it was like 4 in the morning, but this place had a slow response time over drive-thru speaker - including unexplained pauses - and ran out of rice for my friend's chicken teriyaki bowl. This means that I'm going to pick a different local Jack in the Box to hit up late at night, such as the one on Mountain Vista and Russell. That place totally did have rice when I drove over there, and it was way faster.	1
499	I have been to Loco Patron a handful of times, the food and service have always been mediocre at best. The only thing it has going for it, is that, it is dead on Thursday nights to watch Thursday night football.  This past Thursday (12/4/14) was no expectation. Let me just say, that I have been in the service industry my whole adult life. I've done everything from washing dishes,  hosting, serving, and bartending. I get it. Off days happen. I don't think this was the case.  Our server was....awful. She barely acknowledged us and was inconvenienced to tell us what beers were on draft. When our good arrived, 75% of the orders were wrong. Instead of shredded beef, we all got ground beef. Not a big deal. I'm still going to eat it, but she never came by to ask how everything was. We sat there with empty beer glasses and greasy ground beef. When she saw that we were finished with our food, she handed us our tab and never cleared the table. We paid our bill and apparently she couldn't wait for us to leave to pick up the back book. She opened it up in front of us before we even had a chance to sign the slip. I have NEVER written a bad review before and NEVER tipped less the 20%. I just think that bad service and attitudes shouldn't be enabled. Oh and I forgot to mention the ear piercing full bass techno music that was playing  during the game. Sure it's the bears and the cowboys, I personally could care less, but those are somebody else's teams that want to hear what's going on.  Come on Loco Patron, get it together!	0
500	I  found Customshop to be a really good restaurant. The ambiance was great- a dark bistro, traditional yet modern.  I love their commitment  to supporting local and organic farms and sustainable seafood. Black grouper with sweet potato and pesto, outstanding. \n\nI think it deserves 4 stars but I have to give it three :( for the horrible service. The server had no interest in our table whatsoever. I hope to go back with a better service experience.	2
501	Loved the Happy Hour!  Their bartender Frank is super friendly and made us feel very comfortable.  Taquito appetizers were fresh and very delicious.  We came back every day of our stay.	3
502	Food is made fresh... its good, quick and easy!  Only drawback is that you are essentially eating on the casino floor  ...but got to watch a hockey game while I ate.	3
503	We had a fantastic meal!  The fresh hot bread with soft butter and the mixed greens salad got things off to a great start and then I had the sesame encrusted salmon with mashed potatoes and fried spinich, all of which was perfectly prepared and delicious.  My 8 year-old daughter enjoyed her meal as well (grilled cheese with veggies).  For dessert, we had the Big Daddy chocolate cake, which was wonderful!  Kathy was a terrific server - very efficient and friendly. We will be back!	4
504	There are no words to describe how amazing the food and staff at Bronze Cafe are.  Truly a hidden gem in downtown Vegas. Prepare to become addicted.	4
505	"Pho Kim Long....more like Pho Kim Wrong.\n\nHORRIBLE, RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, DISRESPECTFUL \""MANAGER\"" \n\nI was just at this establishment (at approx. 2:30am) and it was just appalling. I have been here a couple times before and I wasn't expecting such horrible \""management\"" skills from their \""manager\"". The service staff wasn't so bad. Throughout the meal our cups were filled and they made sure everything was up to par. Everything was running smoothly up until the bill arrived. I was in a party of 4 and we needed a split check. We went up to the register to pay and it took a while for anyone on staff to assist us. Once we ask for a split check one server gave us a dumbfounded look and walked away from the register. Then another man went to the register and flat out said \""We don't do split checks.\"" \n\n*Sidenote*\nI have been here before around the same time and they were able to do a split check without any hassle. \n\nI told the guy that they were able to fulfill the request last time but he said, \""Thats impossible, not without my approval\"". He was very rude and when I was explaining this to him he was practically ignoring me and a my group while he was counting money from another party. Flat out ridiculous. He also charged my friend our whole check before we were told we couldn't split it and faked a void. \n\nNO MATTER HOW DESPERATE YOU ARE FOR FOOD ON THE STRIP LATE AT NIGHT YOU'RE SERIOUSLY BETTER OFF AT SOME GREASY DRIVE THRU THAN PHO KIM LONG."	0
506	Really great atmosphere, wines, etc... but I didn't think the food was very good, so I give it only 3 stars.  The bread is very thick and maybe uncooked, no oil.  It was not what I expected.  I was hoping for crunchy bread with creatively delicious toppings.  The toppings are great combinations, just not executed like I expected.  I thought the bruschetta would be warm, but instead it was cold, nothing melded, and the bread was very large.  Great concept, but I don't get all the great reviews.	2
507	Good god, after two trips I can say there is maybe two things on the menu if we were to return i would order. One is an appetizer and the other is a side.  The ahi poke salad and the plantain bananas.  Everything else I have tried as far as the bowls go were absolutely gross in my opinion. I couldn't even stomach the ahi bowl and I LOVE ahi! So i pushed aside my bowl not wanting to tell our waiter i was absolutely disgusted with it since i think thats just rude to say that and omg my poor sister who is a vegetarian wasn't very hungry ordered a side of mac and cheese and said it was the WORST mac and cheese she has ever ate.  I would have easily said something to the waiters about her food since shes my baby sister and as skinny as they come i would tell her to stop playing with it and to let me say something but she just picked up maybe a noodle every  5 min and put it back down.  I would have thought the waiter would have picked up on our lack of interest in our food with completely full bowls but obviously no S**t's were given.  Nice to know hula Nice to know.	0
508	My husband and I purchased tickets for our two day vegas trip via ticketmaster, full price at that. I would not sit through this show again for free. I think the five stars comes from the very select few that were chosen to participate in the show. So much time was wasted with the blue man troop carousing through the audience choosing people to be part of the skits. So boring. My husband and I powered through the show but kept humming and hawing and checking our watches. Skits were cheesy and long drawn out! For $75 a ticket I should have had my mind blown. Also it was overly obvious the musical drums were preprogrammed, not being played live. I thought that was the point. It was a big mish mash of pointless cheap laughs. Up the show or lower the price!!!	0
509	ok-ish pool hall. it was an awesome place back in the days which was a long time ago for me (think 10 years ago).\n\ngreat place to bring a date and get some pool game going or some bowling. which girl doesn't like bowling? that was back in the days.\n\nfast forward to today, i still go when the bff wants to play some pool downtown and hit the clubs afterwards. its full of students just like i remember. usually, the time we go, there isn't much people or they all leave by midnight so it gets quite empty so service is faster than usual.\n\nthere's better place to hang out as adults but if you want some younger crowd, hey, go you	1
510	Came here for HH during a working wknd in Vegas... this is located inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel/Casino.\n\nCan't really comment on the dining experience but I will say they had a great lounge area and stiff drinks. Good tuna tartare and excellent rock shrimp tempura. Service was spot on (at least in the bar/lounge area).	2
511	"Meh, I don't get the big deal over this place. Ordered the Mel's \""special\"" breakfast (toast, eggs, taters, and a side dish) with a milkshake and it came to $10. It may sound okay to some but that was one of the most mediocre dishes I've ever had; certainly not worth $10. Buy yourself some eggs and fancy bread and you'll be much more satisfied."	1
512	This place has gone down hill. I used to take my family here from time to time for a decent Italian chain meal but the quality of service an good has declined. \n\nThe waiter was polite but not present for long periods of time. The lobster ravioli were bland and the presentation was sloppy. Looked like they just plopped it on the plate. The chicken and portobello mushroom was not bad but under seasoned and didn't have enough sauce. The one thing that made me still give them a three was the pizza for the kids. It was a really nice pizza and looked like a homemade Italian pizza. Otherwise I would have given them a 3 star. \n\nI won't be back.	2
513	The worst experience dealing with a hostess, we talk to the manager and he was worthless too.  I wanted to order a pitcher of  angry orchard beer and the waitress told me that I could not order it because they didn't offer that beer in a pitcher.  So I asked to speak to the manager again and I asked him why I could not order a pitcher of angry orchard?  He told me the alcohol content in that beer was too high and that they could not sell it as a pitcher, I told him that beer had the same level of alcohol content that Bud Light and all the other beers.   As I was speaking with him a birthday party was being conducted at the bar and there was about 12 young man highly drunk and making fools of themselves.   The food server the nice young lady with the wild finger nails  was outstanding!  Once again though the food was very good .  The server will be the only reason we probably will go back the manager was a fool and the hostess was very rude amazing how they stay in business.  Check out the drunks in the picture I post, I can't get a pitcher of beer but they can serve multiple shots to young people that are  totally wiped out.   Totally incredible!	1
514	Had the Crunchy Chicken Spinach Salad while waiting for my oil change and it was totally great. Service was fine, though the place was nearly empty.\n\nThe decor involves a lot of red, black-and-white checkers, that nostalgic glitter diner furniture, and a bit of automobile nostalgia. My coffee was slightly stale, but that's any diner for you. I could have asked for a replacement.\n\nThis is also the first place I've seen in Henderson with an actual lunch counter, if that's your thing. I'm sure there's gotta be more lunch counters in Henderson...	2
515	"I was super excited when my friends told me we were staying at this hotel. 1. It was newer than other hotels. 2. It has two of the clubs I typically go to when I'm in Vegas. 3. They have my favorite restaurant. 4. I heard good things about this hotel. 5. It's also one of the high end hotels. \n\nHowever, I give this hotel a 2. Reasons\n\n1. The shower had water mold ( when you don't scrub your shower pink mold starts to form) I thought to myself are you serious?! \n2. We asked house keeping to bring toothpaste and a towel. Yay they brought the toothpaste but forgot the towel. Good job house keeping for doing your job half way. On top of that when we were talking to house keeping to bring our request up they acted like we were drunk guests who just wanted those items. Not everyone that goes to Vegas gets drunk. So regardless if you assume that person is drunk don't talk to them like they are stupid. Didn't you know that the tone of your voice could be heard by the other person? \n3 . My group went to edc so we were dressed the part. It's pretty easy to get lost. When we got back to the hotel I asked one of the security where encore was. He looked at me and asked are you staying at this hotel? I mention yes I am so please direct to encore. He goes and says \""can you put something on?\"" Seriously?!! The staff need to know certain events people wear different things. I should have told security \"" yes I can put something on if you direct me to my hotel room where my luggage happens to be.\"" Not only did the security make me feel unwelcome but he did not direct me to my hotel room. \n4. I love edm however, for those people that wants to rest you will be hearing music all night.\n\nI must say the beds are comfortable, rooms are beautiful, and the view is great. Seriously it's not worth staying here because of my experience with customer service and how disgusting the bathroom was. I do recommending staying at palazzo"	1
516	Terrible customer service and website cost me $100 as their website let me place an order online, while I had an installer working on the project. I got an email saying it was ready for pick up and was 10 miles away from home before they called me to say they did NOT have any of what I needed. I had checked twice in the two days before today to make sure they had stock at other stores as my local store was out. \n\nSo since I was driving I asked them to check stock at other stores (as I had already checked the one 3 miles from my house). She told me there is NONE anywhere in the state as it is special order. \nSo I sent the installer home, and now it is going to cost me another trip charge to come back to finish the job.\n\nSo then I call their Corporate 'Customer Care' line who finds stock 25 miles from my house and tells me they can give me 10% off for my trouble. I already had 10% off on line from coupons so this was insulting. Then they promised to call me back, and never did.\n\nBetween their website that will tell you one store is out of stock and another has stock even though they have NONE, and a Customer Service person giving out mis information, I will have to spend my time and gas to go get the products, and pay an additional trip charge to my installer. At least if the Customer service person took the time to check, I could have driven and gotten the product and gotten my project done today, with 'just' my time and gas being wasted.	0
517	I know of only 2 places that make fast food turkishstyle and this is the best one.\nI honestly believe it's the best quick bite in the downtown area.\n\nPros:  Amazing bread, kebab, chicken and filet mignon, the salad is always fresh and complements the meal quite nicely. I cannot stress how delicious the meats are and the breads are also a delight.\n\nCons: Lamb is pricey ($10 for sandwich and $20 for plate.\nThe side of bulgur is not good and cold mush (no rice or fries to substitute). \nLast issue is you only get half a bread for a plate even though it's twice the price of a sandwich. So better to take 2 sandwiches with 2 yummy breads.\n\nThe interior decorating is lifted out of a failed nightclub and the uneven tables seem to wobble a bit, but who cares.\n\nThe service is also pretty friendly, but you have to give them a few minutes to make the food. This is not a standard shish taouk joint.	4
518	"Before I say anything the food Wingstop sells is amazing. I'll continue to eat it, just not at this location. I normally go to the one on Nellis and Stewart. They never mess my order up and they're really friendly. It wasn't till this month that I started going to this Wingstop location on Maryland parkway. Again food was great however the customer service I experienced had to be the worse I've ever dealt with in my LIFE!!! I placed my order through the app around 8 pm for pick up at 11:15 pm. I get to Wingstop at exactly 11:13 pm hoping for my food that I had order 3 hours ahead of time. I give Arcoiris my name and I let her know that I'm there to pick up an order. She then says \""we don't have anything under your name\"" I  tell her I placed it over the app. She then knew what I was talking about and told me that order was scheduled to be picked up at 11:15 to which I said \""fine I'll wait a minute then\"" it was then when Arcoiris realized she had fucked up and never placed my order. Even though she had the form right next to the register with a huge note that said place at 11 pm. So now I'm there waiting for my food like an idiot. I didn't get an apology or anything, not even a cup of water. Then once I finally had my food I checked it and  missing 3 rolls so I had to wait another 5 minutes by the time I left Wingstop it was 11:50. I was going to give them a bad review then but I figured I give them a second chance and I did yesterday and same shit horrible service I'm not even going to bother writing about it. All that matters which I find funny is that I learned that Arcoiris the girl who had fucked up my order a week ago is a supervisor!!! So she should of known better the first time. I found out because the girl that rang us up tonight was having issues with our order and had to call her supervisor. Who happened to be her. Anyways never going back here and I don't plan on recommending this place to anyone EVER. If you guys want Wingstop go to any other location."	0
519	I had a great time the two times I have gone, I really liked that one side had techno and the other side dance/hip hop.  Wish the dance music side was bigger like the techno side. Although I love both types of music I think when people go dancing they are going to dance to hip hop/ dance music and that side gets very over crowded, making it a little hard to dance.  Its been a while since I've gone out and I do not go out to clubs very often, so my experiences with clubs out here is fairly minimal. I am originally from NYC and have been to some pretty great places in NY in the past but this is probably one of the better clubs I have been to here in AZ so far.  Its empty until 11-11:30pm as most places are in Scottsdale, then it gets really crowded quickly but if you get there slightly earlier you can avoid  the long lines. The only  reason I went was to enjoy the  dancing and have a great time with friends but I am not really into that whole club scene. Wish there was a place to go dance without the constant bad pick up lines, but that just naturally comes along with that territory. :)  to expect any less would probably be a little foolish. Despite the corny pick up lines I will go back again sometime because overall it was a really fun atmosphere and I had a great time there dancing with my friends!	2
520	Oh the smell of Olive Garden.  Isn't that the most recognizable smell? I swear I think they pipe it into the vents.\n\nWhen I worked at PV mall I felt positively fancy to eat salad and bread sticks for lunch here.  And at $3.95 it was quite the bargain when it wasn't an official lunch menu item.  Now they've made it $5.95 for soup and salad w/ breadsticks which still isn't a bad deal.  But now of course it doesn't taste quite as good as when I thought it was healthy.\n\nAs for the other food, I was turned off when I had 2 different friends work there who specifically told me not to go there.  Well, not that it was bad or I'd get sick, but that it was to Italian food what Taco Bell was to Mexican food.  When they said that if I could microwave, I could cook at Olive Garden, I decided to trust them.  I'll admit I've been a few times with them when I'm with other folks who really really wanted to go.  The last time I went was maybe 9 months ago and what really struck me were the prices.  I can get fresh ingredients and real cooking for that price - and generally better service.  \n\nThe best thing I can say about this place is how many jobs it's given my friends over the years because they have such an amazing turn over they will hire just about anyone.  This is a great place to get a job to get server experience.  And once you've learned the art of hospitaliano, you can go get a better job.  Just like everyone else.  But it will still take at least 3 months for the smell of Olive Garden to get out of your clothes and your car.	1
521	"Checked-in on a Monday night, checked-out on Wednesday afternoon. Came from the most frightening hellhole of a hotel called Tropicana. Paid $55 a night!\n\nNot the most amazing of hotels or casinos, I will say that. You'll find flashier, newer, and more dazzling on the strip, of course. But our room was clean and a welcome respite after the shock of the Tropicana, which I suppose wasn't saying much, so I'll say this: it's a normal, nice-but-not-luxurious hotel room. Decor was fairly modern, if simple. \n\nWe had some difficulties with the front desk: key cards kept screwing up, and the front desk line is always like forever-and-a-day long. But they always brought towels up when we asked (we asked a few times!), and room service was prompt. \n\nI did have a run-in with one of the valets, when I needed to catch my friends who I had JUST let out of my car. They were headed up to the room and I was going to go park, but had given them the wrong key. I moved my car out of the main overhang area, jumped out, and the valet started shouting bloody-murder about how he needed my keys. I ran inside anyway, gave the room key to my friends, and when I returned to my car about 1.5 mins later, the valet was still standing in front of my car, giving me the evil eye. He then asked \""What my problem was.\"" I told him to go park a car or something and left. It was just weird and overbearing. I suppose he deals with Vegas d'bags all the time, but it's not like I left my car there for an hour and a half, right? And considering that I saw the same cache of cars sitting in that area the entire three days I was there, I didn't think it was that big of a deal to jump out for a minute and a half. \n\nSo, if you're looking for a value, I'd say this is a \""You get what you pay for, and a little more\"" scenario. You won't regret your choice, but you're not staying at the Bellagio."	2
522	I rear ended someone and the damage to my car was bad! My insurance didn't cover it, so I had to pay completely out of pocket. Ultra Collision fixed my car for HALF the price of all the other estimates I got. Not only did Steven work really hard to get me the best price possible, but the whole process took less than a week and the car looks amazing! I am so happy!	4
523	One of the hottest restaurants around is located within Eureka Casino on East Sahara. Before Fat Choy, Chef Sheridan Su (former executive chef at Comme Ca) was serving Great Bao in the most unlikely place; a nail salon. I never tried it back then because I have an aversion to the smell. Dining with salon fumes never seemed appetizing in the least bit. I never tracked down the food truck, and it's taken me sometime to travel to the eastside, but I've finally done it. The Eureka Casino was nicer than I expected and I had heard interesting characters patronize the casino. However, on Sunday afternoon it was clean, quiet and no characters in sight. Not sure what it says about me, but I felt right at home. We strolled back to Fat Choy and took a seat. \n\nThe waitress brought over menus; they had a limited selection and no rice or noodle dishes. We selected the duck bao ($7), and the tofu mushroom bao ($6) after she suggested it over the pork belly ($7). We also ordered the short rib grilled cheese ($10) and the nutella roti ($6) for dessert. We chose a plain old diet coke and diet dr. pepper from their new soda machine with dozens of flavors. Our bao came out first. Duck and pork belly were brought out. The order was wrong, but we stuck with it. The buns are steamed to perfection. The pork belly was fantastic, the fat rendered perfectly so it was rich, tender and filled with that wonderful pork flavor. I loved the freshness from the cilantro and greens, and the texture of the crushed peanuts. This was indeed great bao. The duck was delicious too. The hoisin sauce was light and didn't overwhelm the duck at all. Now, I'm curious how the mushroom and tofu bao would be. Tasty, I'm sure. \n\nThe short rib grilled cheese comes with provolone and cheddar, onion jam and a side of marinara sauce. I'm a purist when it comes to grilled cheese; I'd prefer it with only one type of cheese. I thought the two cheeses made it a bit greasy, the sourdough bread grilled beautifully and the short rib was tender and flavorful with the onion jam. The marinara was thick from the tomato paste. Again, not my preference, but still all the components make and enjoyable sandwich. My husband liked it just fine. My tastebuds just didn't concur. There was nothing notable about the fries. \n\nThe Nutella Roti had me intrigued, nutella, mascarpone, honey and walnuts on roti... what's not to love? The wait, as it turns out. We waited and waited and waited. We would've cancelled had our waitress been around. She conveniently disappeared. We waited and waited some more. It was ridiculous. We asked the other waitress and she said it would be right up. We waited and waited. Finally, the pancake topped with goo was brought to the table. The pancake was incredibly greasy, aside from that the flavors were pretty good, but definitely not worth the wait. I could be more forgiving if it were busy, but we were one of three tables. I'd hope they weren't that far in the weeds with seven diners.\n\nOur patience wore thin; we refused to be held hostage for our bill so my husband went to the counter to take care of it. The eats are pretty darn tasty. I'd return for more bao and I'd love to try the duck rice and potstickers. I certainly hope service will be improved.	2
524	The food is just fine; i had bibimbap. But the service is horrible! horrible! I was shock by how terrible their service was! and also they impose 18% of gratuity on the bill, which doesn't make sense at all. The environment just makes me not want to go again :(	1
525	"I've come to this Meineke a few times with good results. Recently I brought my car in to get an estimate on some inner tie rods and a lower control arm that needs to be replaced. I got a call from them an hour later asking me if I am going to be able to afford to get this repaired right now or not (seriously). I replied, \""that really depends on how much it's going to cost\"". They said they would take a quick look at it and get me a quote. Hours later I went back in because I hadn't heard anything and it was almost closing time, walked in to a full crew sitting around in the office just hanging out and was told they were trying to research and that these parts are not easy to find. Really? On a 2005 Dodge? That was probably 10 days ago and they still haven't called me back. Every other shop I called was able to get me a quote within 30 minutes and didn't insult me by questioning my ability to pay. Regardless of what (or if) their quote comes back at I can tell you they have not earned my future business."	1
526	"This place was ok. I was with great friends on a birthday outing, so we could've been anywhere to have a fab time (and we did sample a few places that night). We had a good time by virtue of being the fun girlies we are, but I won't go out of my way to return to this particular bar.  I will, however, return to the Cosmo just for the secret pizza place...it's unmarked down a long dark hallway and has awesome pizza AND an old-timey arcade game and pinball machines. Sorry...did I digress? That's how interesting the Chandelier Bar was to me.\n\nIt's a multi-level bar with decent bartending (in fact, the barkeeps did present a touch of class to the place). The chandelier over the liquor bottles  was kinda pretty, but the plastic \""chandelier\"" that draped from floor to ceiling...meh. Was pretty tacky looking, actually...reminded me of a giant version of the Mardi Gras beads you get for showing your boobies. Maybe they were going for Diva but got closer to Dive-y. I know it's Vegas, but there are plenty of less tacky places to hang. It felt very dated and old-fashioned. Dated can be good if there's at least a pinch of glam, but the obviously plastic almost-shimmer fell short of that pinch. Call me a snob, but it felt good to leave the verging-on-suffocatingly naff decor."	1
527	"I know it's busy here, but all I want to do is buy a MacBook Air and get out of here. Unfortunately I'm waiting here 20 minutes while all the \""genius'\"" stand around watching their clients play. Am I the only one wanting to buy here and they are too busy or me? Poor service.."	0
528	I would have given 3 stars except the fact that their Internet service was so slow I couldn't even open my email account while staying here for work. When I called to check on it they said there was nothing they could do. What? It's 2013. Not 1983. I would never stay here again. We thankfully got our rates on Priceline but I would never pay over 70 dollars a night for this place. And if you need Internet so you can do you work don't stay here at all.	1
529	it's Monday night and I'm on hold trying to make a group reservation (they consider 8 people a LARGE group)\nI speak direclty to someone at the restaurant and they decide they don't want to deal with me, so they tell me they're going to transfer me to group reservations. LIAR! she transfered me to Caesar's restaurant line (which I already know is unable to reserve LARGE parties.  So i'm a ping pong between the lines for about 15 minutes...ya, I even wrote this review while I waited!!! HA! A guy by the name of Brandon tells me they'll have to take my number and call me back...let's see when and IF they call me back!!!	0
530	Not four seasons worthy! Food was salty and amateurish, as was the staff. the transition from the bar to the restaurant was awkward. Our sides came after the main dish had been eaten and they were the wrong side dishes, which might have been ok if the entire salt shaker had not been dumped into it!  The only saving grace was the manager who realized how awful the service and food were.  Don't bother driving that far north, stop when you get to Mastro's.	1
531	Wahoo!  They have a location in Vegas!!  I used to be a regular in various locations around SoCal... so when a friend mentioned this place recently opening up... I had to pay this place a visit.  Unfortunately it's location is a bit obscure... you wouldn't really run into it randomly unless you live in the area.  Google it and try it out.\n\nI like the fish tacos and the maui bowl... but mix it up and find your favorites, there's plenty to choose from.  If you can't decide, let the bartender or server order for you :)  \n\nThey've got video poker machines at the bar as well as Thirsty Thursdays! (1/2 off draft beers...Sam Adams please.  Always a good choice...)	3
532	It's a flat odd coloured mess, I can't wait to go back. I had the Dic Ann cheeseburger and sauce, which is a flat cheeseburger with meat sauce, and they give you a popsicle stick to lift it out of the cardboard basket. And the flattest hot dog with all the fixins, I can't really explain it, but it was squashed and tasty. Think White Castle but with Wolverine-like origins, from the Wilds of the Canadian wilderness, Montreal.	2
533	I've been to Belium, this is the best I've had since then.\n\nThe attention to the batter is clear- the waffle alone is worth 5 stars.  Combine it with some strawberries or Dave and Andy's Ice Cream? It gets better.\n\nThe prices are very reasonable and the waffles are surprisingly filling (be open to sharing one!).	4
534	So I walked this bridge many times on my way back and fourth from the Pirates game. The Bridge is closed during Pirate games, but has a safe walking area even when cars are allowed on.  The bridge has beautiful views and on one end a guy selling $1 waters and Pirate Swag.	4
535	Worst place ever. Not only did they get my order wrong, they didn't put CHICKEN in our chicken sandwich! All it had was cheese and bacon between two buns! Our sodas were filled with ice that the straw would not fit and they were flat. The girl working the drive thru seemed nice, but I would have preferred to have gotten what I ordered.	0
536	"I went on a Tuesday which is clearly the \""off night.\""  I was in town for an interview and I arrived a day early.  I LOVE the Howl in Houston, so I decided to check it out.  I was there with the AARP set, and a few middle aged couples.  There were probably about 15 people in the whole bar.  The musicians were awesome (as are all Howl at the Moon musicians)  I would love to come here on the weekend.  I hope I get the job!"	2
537	"If I could give no stars, I would.\nI need to preface this review by stating that I have been going to Joe Beef for the last half decade. I loved this restaurant. LOVED IT. My husband and I make a yearly trip from NYC to Montreal, and make it a point to go to Joe Beef. And every time we've gone, we've dropped a serious amount of cash on it--we actually save up to do so, because we love it that much.\nWe went this year, having missed going last year because it was closed so the owners could open their new restaurant, and believe me when I say we lamented the loss all year long. This year we took my husband's parents for the first time, and were very excited to have them experience it.\nWhen I say this was the worst restaurant experience of my life, understand that it pains me to do so. And when I say that not only was the initial experience bad, but the follow up and subsequent experience trying to contact Joe Beef for an explanation was worse, please understand what an incredible disappointment that was. When you're a loyal customer who has actually sent friends and family over the border to spend money at a restaurant, has purchased your cookbooks to give to people, and is in general one of the people who has helped you, with dollars and loyalty, get where you are, and you're completely disregarded, there is nothing more shameful or sad. And I say this now, again: you should be ashamed, owners of Joe Beef. And for all those who have had good experiences there, please understand, the second you have a TERRIBLE experience, you'll find yourself on the same side of the fence I'm currently on, and realize that these restauranteurs care about nothing more than your dollars.\nThe experience, to sum it up as quickly as possible: the oysters were wonderful, but they're always wonderful. I found it odd that they've abandoned serving the oyster sauces in metal cups, instead opting for those strange disposable paper cups you get medicine in at the hospital, but whatever. My fault for ignoring warning signs of lower quality. After the oysters, it was all terrible.\nWe waited over an hour for our appetizers. My husband got some kind of spam-like thing with macaroni in it that was oversalted and made me ill to even try, and both my FIL and MIL got a cold soup. Both of their soups came out luke warm. It being a 90+ degree day, and the fact that the AC was barely working in the restaurant, my MIL sent it back and told the waiter it was fine, she would go straight to her main course. We had already waited over an hour for apps, so we didnt want to risk pushing the mains out further by waiting for another soup, and besides, she said it was way too salty for her to eat. The waiter came straight back with the soup, and to cool it down, what had he done? He put ICE CUBES in it. We immediately sent it back.\nWe waited another hour plus for our main course. At this point, we should have left. My favorite dish, the lobster pasta, was missing every ingredient but the lobster, cream, and pasta; my husband's steak was overcooked; my MILs duck was chewy and the sides that came with it, too salty to eat. We barely ate our meal. The bill came (approx $400) and there was an extra alcoholic beverage thrown on there, I guess to push some salt in the wound. Nothing was comped, no apologies, just thanks for your money.\nTHE WORST PART: Husband and I left completely defeated and dejected. It felt like someone had died; it felt like a loss. Our favorite restaurant in Montreal was gone. I went on the Joe Beef facebook page to leave a comment, which was neither nasty nor cruel, and within 10 minutes, the comment was gone: no response, no nothing. Just deleted. I took screenshots of course, and posted something again, screenshots of the original comment included. Again, deleted. No comment. The least they could do was respond to me--even a \""We're so sorry for your experience\"" blah blah blah would have been honorable and nice, but no. Nothing. So I posted a screenshot of the last deleted comment, and commented again. I don't think I need to tell you how quickly it was deleted. And that I'm now blocked.\nTo me this speaks to restauranteurs who don't care for their customers, don't stand by their food, and don't respect the people who pay their bills. I've never had an experience where a business has just deleted bad reviews and ignored their customers in such a way. I'm shocked and saddened by the immaturity and senselessness of it. If I were eating at McDonald's, whatever. But to drop almost half a grand on a meal and be completely ignored and disregarded? That isn't right; they should be ashamed. For all those with good experiences, I hope they continue, because I know what a good Joe Beef experience is like, and it is wonderful. But I hope for your sake that you don't ever have to go through what we went through, because Joe Beef has proven he won't care."	0
538	Margarita in a cup for 16 dollars? I would rather just get a Fat Tuesday........ \n\n\nThe watermelon margarita was really good though... but I'm not sure if she added alcohol......................	2
539	Average burger, average taste, above average prices. Anyone who thinks this is good food has no credibility when it comes to food. If you want cheap cheese, bland meat, and a lot of grease and want to pay too much this is the place. I go to Columbus OH for work, Graffiti burger is the place over there. They have a big sign over the Five Guys in Columbus. I passed by the Five Guys, almost empty, go to Graffiti, PACKED. There is a reason for that, they serve the best burgers around. I so wish AZ had a place like that. Until that happens, I am in search for the best burger in AZ.	0
540	This is one of the best bars in town! If you have out of town guests, bring them to the Dirty Dogg Saloon. This place is edgy and fun. You and your guests will have a blast watching the girls dance on the bar. They play great music, and a lot of great people hang out there.	4
541	Very clean, fast service, very nice employees and good subs!!	3
542	"Great location! Beautiful facility, all renovated, gym, pool, great meeting rooms, wonderful bistro, and quiet hallways. I was extremely pleased! I went for an event and they did a great job of coordinating the activities and giving \""great room\"" area for meet and greets. The bistro is a great place to hang out and have a light meal or coffee and meet others too. The staff was super super nice and seemed to love their jobs, even the cleaning crew was super cheerful and nice."	4
543	"Now, I am very hesitant to give a dentist 5 stars.  I mean if I was rating dentists as a whole, I would give them negative stars.  I have gone to a *lot* of dentists in my day and would never have considered giving one above 3 stars.  Then, I met Dr. Wyatt.  \n\nFirst, his helpers are super helpful and friendly.  They are nice and sometimes when they ask a question, they actually take the tools out of your mouth for you to answer!\n\nSecond, Dr. Wyatt himself follows suit and is nice.  Even when you have issues he's nice about it.  He doesn't lecture or raise his voice or even seem angry that you don't do something, like oh floss all the time...  He truly seems like he wants you to have a happy, healthy smile, not like he is frustrated with your behavior.\n\nLastly, his office is called \""Reel Dental\"" and they have a movie theme.  Though somewhat cheesy, it's nice to have movies on in the waiting room and such.  Rumor has it that when you go in for long dental work, which I never have, you can watch a movie while it's done!  Anything to take your mind of the fact you're in a dentist chair is great.\n\nOh, and for the ladies, he's quite easy on the eyes to look at while being worked on!"	4
544	We had the Mini-Hot Pots with Seafood spread and Beef spread with tons of veggies and luckily there wasn't a wait when we came on the Friday evening. \n\nWe also ordered the Fruit-Fusion Green Tea, which was delicious and different than the green tea served at most other restaurants. \n\nThe Dipping sauce is probably my favorite of all time, where I could order a side of rice and devour it all!	3
545	"I dare you to think about The Diamond without also thinking of The Penguin. Seriously, go on, try. You can't. The situation that went down at the end of The Penguin's last life turned into that big hubbub which rolled nicely over into hype, hope and hyperbole of how The Diamond would save us all, forever - or at least for lunch and dinner. Time passed, The Diamond doors and shutters stayed frustratingly closed even though we KNEW something was going on. I think by the time they posted on their Facebook page on Valentine's Day the hint that this would, at long last, be THE week of arrival for our blue-hued savior, the line was forming from the front doors down to Elizabeth. \n\nI was lucky enough to be one of the chosen few to attend a preview night before the opening so I could go forth and spread the word of Brian & Jimmy. We were the first in the door on Wednesday night and I got that nervous feeling like I'd had too much coffee and snuck into a movie. I ordered the legendary Full Hemi and fried pickles - is there any way to start this food affair without a burger? - and I was reasonably pleased. The burger was a bit different, most noticeably that it held together. Everything else about the food was just like I remembered The Penguin. I snuck in again on Friday on the official opening day and had an experience much like I used to get midday at that legendary dive; sitting up at the bar counter and chatting aimlessly with someone from a much different walk of life from us Plaza-Midwood hipsters while I noshed on (yes, another) burger. I caught a glimpse into the kitchen in back and made eye contact with my neighbor, one of the cooks - he gave me a perfect look of exasperation and mimed pulling out his hair. Opening day (and week, and month) at the Diamond was in no way a walk in the park.\n\nI heard and read quite a few reviews of really bad service in those first few weeks. Honestly, I'm not too surprised - the place was in such a panic in the beginning there that I'm sure the staff had absolutely no clue how to keep up. That doesn't excuse the bad service, which there probably is, but I can understand being overloaded operationally. It's rough and I really do hope that they can get it under control. There's so many new things on the menu that the staff, though experienced from the bird, has to learn how to manage a whole new level of complexity in the kitchen. They will get it, eventually. The hype didn't give them much time to get up to speed before they became The New Place To Have Lunch and Dinner for everyone.\n\nI've branched out a bit on the last few visits, and I've found many things on the menu that were decent to great. The meatloaf was okay, a little crunchy for my tastes; the sides were awesome (especially a killer mac 'n cheese) and the fries were a heck of a lot better than the Penguin's bag potatoes. \n\nSee, there I go again. Talking about the Penguin. How can you not?\n\nThe real \""a-ha\"" moment I had was my visit last night with Danielle - I got a Small Block with bacon & cheese (old habits die hard) and she ended up with the Po' Greek Boy platter. My burger was the best I'd had there yet (I think they're starting to get the hang of the new recipe) and the fried pickles were exactly as crisp as I hoped for. But then I took a bite of the Po' Greek Boy and it was like a switch flipped in my head. This was an awesome new flavor to me: lamb patty with tzatziki sauce and some fixins on a bun. Maybe you have had it, but I definitely never had, and my taste buds did that little happy dance you'd see in cartoons. I suddenly could not wait to try the new ideas that Brian & Jimmy mixed up for The Diamond's menu. Service is rough right now, yeah, but this is an experienced crew that took a crummy dive and turned it into a legend. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more five-star reviews months or years down the road. So as I chewed and savored the Po' Greek Boy aftertaste, I reached my thesis statement for this review, words with which I hope you will swirl around in your mind as you contemplate The Diamond:\n\nThe greatness of The Diamond lies not in the nostalgia and revival of its past; the greatness of The Diamond lies in the promise and potential of its future.\n\nSo chew on that! I'll be back."	3
546	Hands down, best yogurt in all of lv and I assure you, I've been to all of them. The pumpkin pie flavor is BOMB!!!	4
547	So I'm a coffee fan through and through, and Starbucks to be sure is near the top my list usually. While this Starbucks is fine, staff service seems to be lacking. \n\nService is make a break, and unfortunately it's not making the grade today.	2
548	Whenever you're in Vegas.. Make sure to hit up this place..  I strongly suggest getting the bottle service... And if you do... Holla at my friend Shannon Belshoy (bottle agent) She is very courteous and professional.. Good Times	4
549	Here is what is required to make box brownie mix:\n- A large mixing bowl\n- A mixing spoon\n- An egg\n- A little Veggie Oil\n- A brownie pan\n\nIf you have those, you should never, and I mean never, waste your time or money on these brownies. The packaging is fantastic, it's very cute. If I could wrap my Betty Crocker Box Hershey Syrup brownies in these sachets I would and send them all over as gifts. They are 10000 times better.\n\nI hate to be harsh but I've NEVER rejected a brownie/sweets before I tasted this monstrosity. I received a dozen or so in the mail as a gift. I was so excited, not for the extra calories I thought I'd pack on, but particularly because of the toffee brownie I am a HUGE fan of toffee. \n\nI bit in and was instantly disgusted, it taste literally like a brick of sugar. No rich chocolate taste. The texture is ALMOST GOOD but then it starts to grit in your mouth like sugar grains.\n\nIt took me three days to finally finish off that toffee brownie. Normally would have been three minutes.\n\nTrust me, make your own and send them, it will be much more tasty. For no reason should you ever make someone suffer through these.\n\nIt's not a corporate gift, it's an insult.\n\nI'd rather have a cheese ball. \n\n(Ok, I am being dramatic, I really like this company, and I like that their headquarters are in my hometown and I love the packaging, but their brownies do suck. And it's hard to mess up a brownie.)	1
550	Great Venue so much better than a completely indoor one. It gets way to hot and stuffy when you are completely inside. They have a hot dog stand at least when me and my hubby were there they did and it was great to have some munchie food. The bartenders know how to pour their drinks. They are expensive but we'll worth it. I'll happily go here again.	3
551	small limited very reasonably priced friendly employees unique speciality items but not intended for your complete shopping needs this location is steady busy with lots of parking	2
552	"This place is the best.  \n\nFirst of all, nobody beats that $20 bruschetta and wine deal on Mondays and Tuesdays.  The bruschetta is delicious, there's a ton of it, and the wine doesn't come from a \""bargain menu\"".  This deal makes the day-specific special offers of other restaurants look stingy and pitiful. \n\nEverything I've had there is delicious and the service is always great.  My only complaints are the casualties of visiting an awesome place: the wait for seating, and for the bathroom.  I'm not used to waiting 45 minutes to get in to a place, but I'll do it for Postino."	4
553	I've had better Indian food, especially for the price.  But, they are in the old port of Montreal, someone has to pay for that rent!  I've also had better service, the waiter was a real jack ass.  The guy I went with did not leave a tip due to the poor service, and the waiter followed us into the street accosting him for a tip.\n\nI ordered saag paneer ($17), it tasted good but it arrived in small quantity, and the naan, while good is expensive at $4 per piece.   Note that they also close between lunch and dinner seating's. \n\nI do not plan on returning to this restaurant	1
554	Came for a friend's birthday and really was not that impressed. First of all, it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back. On Saturday if you are there before 7pm, all alcohol was 1/2 off and some appetizers were on special. We ate dinner there and the menu was very limited. The food was okay, but our burgers were over cooked. The service was slow and it took us a while to get our check. I'd go to hang out again and have a few drinks, but I wouldn't suggest making this your regular hang out.	2
555	We needed a plumber to replace our pressure reducing valve\nA friend told me about Colburn Enterprise - best thing that could happen to us\nJohn came out check the valve - replaced it - asked use if we had any question on anything\nGreat Guy - Great Service - Great price\nI will be recommending Colburn Enterprises to all my friends and neighbors who might need a plumber!\nThey are the best in my book by far!!	4
556	Today we checked out this place after reading all positive reviews. We stared with the the shabu shabu salad which was great - 4 stars. Next, the 3 preparation mussel appetizer, also great and fun - 4 stars. The 1st main dishes was Miso spaghetti with sausages and mushrooms, yummy!! 4 starts. Next was the squid ink pasta for $19, it is expensive and sadly lacks in any flavor or acceptable qualities - 1 star. I have had several great squid ink dishes in the past, this one lacked any texture or taste... it was very basic. We ate a few bites and moved on to dessert. The dessert was a pudding suggested by the waitress, was amazing and yummy. It's a bit pricy... but lacks on the high quality wow factor for the prices. I would eat again, but only a simple bowl of pasta... for like 8-10$. Its more of a noodle shop then a multi course establishment.  Service staff was great and very friendly.	2
557	"Poor excuse for BBQ.\n\nWe were the only ones in there at 5 pm on a Friday...first clue. We ordered Beef Brisket, mashed potatoes, beans, and corn on the cob. \n\nThe mashed potatoes were not only fake \""boxed\"" tasting but also tasted old and completely flavorless. I think they may have been yesterday's leftovers from a local nursing home. If you're going to serve up mashed potatoes from a box, spruce it up a little bit, maybe add some salt or garlic?\n\nThe corn on the cob was tough and chewy.\n\nThe beans were okay, nothing notable about them. I suppose it would be difficult to irreparably mess up beans.\n\nThe beef brisket................dry, gamey, and tough. It was actually difficult for me to swallow it down, that's how gross it was. For the record I am NOT a picky eater. The meat was sickening and I almost felt like I wasn't actually eating beef, but perhaps a local stray dog or some kind of rodent meat. It didn't even taste like beef. \n\nHad we not used the Groupon, we would have asked for our money back and left. I do not recommend this place and we will definitely not be back. I'll stick with Dickey's, Dillon's or Honey Bear for BBQ, or anywhere but Bubba Phatz for that matter."	0
558	This is a really good venue to hold meetings in Edinburgh. We hired the 'Glass Room' at the top of the building which had its own private balcony with stunning views across the city. \n\nThe Hub provided us with lunch - just sandwiches- but they finished it off with some really good, gooey chocolate cake which made me love the whole venue even more!! They also left some Edinburgh rock on the tables for us to munch through...so whenever my meeting became boring/overly bureaucratic I could have a sugar high to bring back my normal hyper-ness!	3
559	Most of this airport seems really nice. The security wasn't bad, but it was late afternoon, so I think we caught a good time.\n\nI, however, got stuck in the Delta terminal, and it was the worst airport experience of my life. First of all, there was a Starbucks that closed at six pm, y'all. SIX. There was this little burrito place that my friend and I decided to eat at because our only other options were Wendy's or a gift/convenience shop. That food was just.. no. It was not the worst I've ever had, but I wish I'd have gotten Wendy's. We were told it was the oldest wing of the airport.\n\nThe lady in the gift shop was really nice and told us our options, which was to go back out and then come back through security, or pick one of the two whole options inside. It was tiny, old, and definitely not built for the 21st century.	1
560	It's got a beautiful view, but well-enclosed (in the summertime, mosquitoes are a problem at Marche Bacchus in the same shopping center).  The french chef offers unique perspectives on other cooking styles.  Burgers, fish dishes and salads all have interesting twists.  I've been here for dinner and it's a very nice place for a family outing.  Service is efficient and friendly.  I'd feel very comfortable having a group of 6-10 here.  Lunch is also a good time here.  It's more mellow, and I've used it many times for business lunches.  The tables are large enough for papers and not so close together than you can hear the other tables' conversation.  \n\nIt's not a 5-star restaurant, but it's never a disappointment.  4-stars all the way.	3
561	I bought a groupon for a 60 minute massage. I unfortunately did not read the reviews below before I made the purchase. In retrospect, the previous reviews are 100% accurate. My experience was pretty much the same. \n\nAlthough my massage wasn't completely terrible, I wish I had gone elsewhere. Yes, the massaeuse was older and it seemed difficult for her to perform a deep tissue massage. Her hands and arms were shaking from applying pressure. She was chewing gum audibly. The music selection was not relaxing by any means. Was that christian rock? Not too mention it wasn't a full hour long. \n\nWhen I walked in, the receptionist had a mouth full of food. She was awkward. The entire office was pretty crappy. There was a make-shift dog play area. When I declined to purchase another massage afterwards, she seemed genuinely disappointed in my answer. Upset even. It was weird. \n\nI hate to give such a poor score, but really... some changes need to be made.	1
562	You were overpriced and full of yourself (Really, charging for wifi? meh), but you left us too soon, Moonstruck.\n\nI liked knowing that if i wanted to spend too much money and feel bad about it later, I could have a reliably delicious mexican mocha with some decent, high quality chocolate.  And your logo was cute.\n\nBut, you know, you could've been more affordable and less pretentious too.  That doesn't mean I wanted the gimmicky yogurt/chocolate/blah place to replace you, though. :(\n\nMoonstruck, your'e like that kid in high school I felt ambivalent about only to find out he's now in jail.  I'm sad for you, but not particularly surprised.	2
563	we spent the first night of my bachelorette party here and loved it so much that we spent our 2nd night here too (after bouncing from rain - totally overrated!). guest list on napkin nights to avoid the cover and i s'pose having a group of 12 buzzed girls helps tooo. be warned about the bathrooms - if you don't close the doors perfectly (they're see-through until you lock it, then turn opaque), everyone'll be watching you (booo, def NOT the best design for drunk peeps that need to pee).	4
564	**WARNING BAD CONTRACTOR**\n\nNot only is Marco the worst contractor I have ever dealt with, he also kept trying getting more money for everything we had already agreed on. He was unprofessional, incompitent, constantly late or no showing and tried to blame me for everthing he screwed up.\n\nThe whole job was completed and looked like hell. The bricks were just laid on the ground instead of cemented in so they were uneven, loose and sinking into yard. The sod had sat in rolls for 6 days so you can imagine how that looked. The yard was a bog because he didn't level and grade it correctly.  And to top it off he damaged my house and brick walls with his bobcat. \n\nAfter I saw how poorly the job was done I threatened to file a claim against his bond with the Register of Contractors and he came over pounding on my door. He literally told me that if I wanted the job done right I should have paid him more needless to say I lost it. After a heated exchange I wrote an amended contract for all the things he would need to fix and he signed it.\n\nHe had his Mesa crew chief come out and in one day with a full crew and they fixed his terrible job. This guy was good on his word and the backyard is... acceptable. The rocks are still not evenly spread but by this point I just wanted them gone. A job that should have taken 2-3 days had taken over 2 weeks and a good portion of my sanity.\n\nWord to the wise. DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY.	0
565	came here for lunch...wish i had made a different choice. the seating process was fine, but the service was horrible. if you ask for no onions on your medium burger you will get lots of onions and a well done burger. order a sandwich with horseradish, prepare to get none. water was barely kept full the whole time.. service was just overall really really pooor. 40 mins to get food, and another 10 to get our check. longest lunch of our hungover life. \n\nsave the trip and time.. maybe i went on a bad day.. but tuesday during summer season isnt and shouldnt be a bad day. never coming here again.	1
566	I just had the worst massage session ever yesterday with a massage therapist initial R. Why it was my worst session you ask? \n1. This massage therapist does not know muscle physiology. He has strength, I give him that but does not have technique to relax a muscle or to perform deep tissue massage. I ask for that technique but he just gave me more strength. \n2. I feel he's trying to rush the session. Very rough on my body and definitely not relaxing. \n3. Very rough hands for a massage therapist. Even with the oil used in the session, my skin felt like it was scrubbed with sand paper. \n4. He puts he light setting so bright, my eyes were watery because of it. Opposite of relaxing. He only dims the light on the last 15 min on my 80 min session. \n5. His stomach keeps gurgling. He didn't apologized for it or ask to be excused an d it's just unpleasant to hear it while you're trying to relax. \n6. I notified him where the most sore spots in my body but since I guess he doesn't know muscles, he just put pressure with his palm and that's it. No specific pressure in sore muscle or anything like that. (How can he pass his certification?)\n7. The day after my massage session, my body feels even more sore compared to before my session. \n8. Also, being a girl, I would've appreciate if you ask first before you massage and mess up my hair during a massage session. \nThe only good thing about my session is that he gave me a couple chocolates after the massage was over. \nHopefully my next massage session won't be this bad. I'll definitely ask for a different massage therapist.	0
567	$50 for a simple lunch for 2? Are you serious?? It was 4 star worthy but for the price, I can't give it 4 stars.\n\nService was really fast which is great! We came on a very rainy Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWe ordered a small salad for $6. It was tiny but the dressing was really great! The small indian soup was also excellent. \n\nWe ordered the kosmos dish and it was OK.. However, the setian tasted strange and I'm generally a fan of tofu.\n\nThe carrot cake was also OK.. a little dry.\n\nSince I frequent these vegan/veggie places often, I know what is good and what should be charged for what I get. The food is a solid 4 stars but.. it's overpriced given the quality and ambiance.	1
568	"Was visiting Vegas, and stopped at Aces and Ales based on seeing it on BrewDogsTV. Overall extremely disappointed, and probably would not come back or recommend to others.\n\nFood/Beverage:(5/5) Unfortunately didn't make it to food, so I can't attest to the quality of the food. The menu choices looked really cool, and I really would have liked to try some of the things. We were fortunate enough to go during their Dark/Rare takeover so there were some GREAT choices on tap (Had Xantus, FW Proprietors, and other excellent curated choices) It was clear from there bottle cooler (including FW Barrel aged verticals) that they really care about beer, and are glad to share it. I would have spent a ton more money here, because the beer selection was great.\n\nDecor: Not bad but not great, (3/5) seating and layout is a little weird, I am not a local, so I don't know the history on this building, but it was just weird. We sat in a community-ish booth in the back corner of the restaurant.\n\nService: (0/5) if I could assign a negative score for service I would do so, and normally I wouldn't give a restaurant a low yelp review for service alone because I know everyone can have a bad day, but the bottom line is the server didn't make it right at all. When we walked in without even saying \""Hello\"" to us, the server handed us the beer menu and said, all of these are 8oz. pours, and they are $8 per pour and this is \""Non-Negotiable\"" and mentioned something quickly about a tasting package and walked away. They were not particularly busy, and she was observed talking with her co-workers, and commiserating with what I assume are regulars that were not seated in her section. She made me feel like a criminal and i am totally the type of beer geek who wouldn't bat an eye at spending $50 on a bomber of beer. One member of my party was so put off by her attitude that he considered walking out without ordering anything, but I pressed on and wanted to give her a chance to redeem herself. She didn't come back for a while, and just brought waters, we were ready to order, but she didn't even ask, and went back to talking with other patrons. finally, several minutes later, another cocktailer came by who was sweet as pie and asked what we needed. We said we were going to just have beers and that we were so put off by the attitude of the other server that we were not going to be eating unfortunately. She apologized and promptly took care of our beers (which were on point). This would have been a turning point for our service, and I was warming up to the idea of ordering food, but apparently the new (and awesome) server had gone back and told the other server about our displeasure, and she came over for an \""apology\"" which really was a confrontation and her telling me \""People here know me, and love me\"" I am always a even keel, mild mannered guy, and normally would have just walked out and never looked back, but honestly, given her attitude, and then basically coming over with a half-hearted apology for \""The way you feel\"" I was done, and told her that she \""can treat her regulars like that if she wants, but she doesn't know me, and I don't appreciate that\"" \n\nAll in all, if you get the right server, this place is probably good, maybe even great, but this was a horrible experience, and almost ruined my trip to vegas."	1
569	"We were disappointed by the food.  We had a table out back, on the pool side of the restaurant (the pool at Caesars is just beyond), and although the interior was fine, and the service was \""okay\"" the food was really disappointing.  Not up to standards for this price range or for a \""signature restaurant\"" at Caesars.  \n\nWe were a group of 4, one vegetarian, the rest not.  The octopus salad was oily and not very interesting, the fried calamari downright bad, and the main dishes not much better.  \n\nI had the gnocchi, and it could have come from a boxed mix.  One diner had the orrecchiette with broccoli rabe, which wasn't bad, just not very creative.  \n\nThe simple pasta with tomato sauce was equally uninspiring.  The meatballs were boring, not what you would expect from an \""anchor\"" Italian restaurant at Caesars.\n\nWe often stay at Caesars or at least visit to gamble when in town (we're also big fans of staying at the Venetian/Palazzo), but we will not be back to Rao's when there are so many better dining options in Vegas."	1
570	TERRIBLE REPAIR. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU CAN AVOID IT!!!!!!...OR if you value your time, the quality of the repair, and your sanity!! \n\nThis review is lengthy, if you want to read my horror story then keep scrolling. \nIf your lacking in time: DONT CHOOSE THIS LOCATION!!!! PERIOD.\n\nThis location has been an absolute nightmare to deal with!!! They don't give a rat's fart about fixing anything the right way. I took my truck in for repair 6 months ago and only just got it fixed properly by another location a few days ago. \n\nGerber on Omaha is incompetent, pay zero attention to detail, and hope that you don't look too closely at their crap work so they can pass by with the least amount of effort on their part.\n\nIf you point something out they try and deflect by making ridiculous excuses. \n\nI told Rudy, a service liaison, that my truck alarm sounded muted/ weird. He was like no that sounds normal. Well RUDY- The Hampton branch confirmed my suspicions and said the alarm speaker was crushed!Thanks Rudy for addressing my concern and at least visually inspecting it before dismissing me.\n\nMy 2nd issue right out of the gate was when they didn't even notice that they hadn't buffed out the giant scuff on my headlight.\n\n3rd they installed my censors upside down!!! My truck would beep intermittently constantly. I had to drive back and forth to a toyota dealership many miles from my home to get it looked at. Not to mention on my own time + gas- at least 4 times. All in the hopes of determining what the problem was. \nEventually a toyota expert discovered the censors had been installed upside down.\n\nNow red flags AND bells are going off about this locations integrity and competence.\n\n4th, I took my truck back because the bumper was not flush and the fender was bent in slightly. How could they overlook this? I spoke with Monica the manager, to address this issue. As a little thank you for my patience they filled in a small chip on my windshield so the crack wouldn't spread. Mind you I had to ask for this and big whoop anyways after what I've already dealt with. \n\nAfter I pick up my truck this time, they threw my front mud flap in the back of my truck and never even bothered to put it back on!!!! \n\nBy this point I'm not a happy camper. \n\nMonica in my opinion only told me what she thought I wanted to hear to appease me. Which is incredibly frustrating. I don't want to hear apologies, I just want it to be fixed. Correctly.\n\n--during my re-do repair at the other location, I got an update saying they repaired the broken alarm speaker and that they found another clip hinge thing that was broken. So to me, it looks like the Omaha branch didn't bother to fix it- most likely because it wasn't visible from the outside. Cool guys. Thanks for taking such good care of me ;(\n\nI have lost sleep over my HORRIBLE experience at this Gerber. I will go out of my way to make sure to post my review on as many platforms as possible so people can make an informed decision to avoid this Gerber Omaha branch AT ALL COSTS. If your insurance suggests this location- drive the extra distance to go somewhere else. TRUST	0
571	"The initial goal was to meet up with a family member that was in town who FLAKED on me.  Looking at the menu before I left I decided to go anyway since the prices weren't too pricey.\n\nThe huddle of hostesses were a disgrace.  The place was relatively empty as we went around 4:30-5pm on a Saturday afternoon/evening.  We received our intial \""hello\"" but after that we pretty much were non-existent.  The blonde girl was applying her lip gloss with her finger when were standing at the hostess station.  Another employee came in with half-a-glass of water that the brunette hostess stowed behind the podium.  The girl with the glass was also waving her paycheck in the area and very RUDELY squeezed past me and the podium without saying excuse me.  I personally make it a point not to mouth off to the staff before I eat because I enjoy food that hasn't been spat on.\n\nBeing successfully irked by the hosting staff, I was pleasantly surprised by the genuine niceness of our server.  She let us know about the specials which weren't bad.  We got the better end of the deal because although it was Saturday the NFL playoff game was going on so our bucket of beer was $5 cheaper.  \n\nOur plates were $7 each which we though were a good deal... until our plates arrived.  They were tiny portions although, they were filling enough for me.  I had the Southwest Taquitos (more like eggrolls...) which were ok.  The pico de gallo had a nice sour taste to it and was well balanced with onions and sprinkles of chopped jalapeno here and there.  My boyfriend got the \""Sherry Ahi Tuna\""  I don't know if that was a typo or what, but it was seared and it was served on top of fried wonton squares which were served on top of the Asian salad.  The smell of sesame oil was delightful, and to be honest... I wanted more of what he had.\n\nThe mechanical bull was pretty entertaining.  A family and all the kids took turns riding it and it was entertaining to see the chubby kid attempt to get on the bull on 3 separate attempts and ultimately had his brother help him on.... And on top of that the look of apprehension on his face was priceless.  He lasted less than a minute.\n\nAll-in-all it was an okay experience.  I will be back, hopefully for the AFC championship (Bolts vs. Colts)."	2
572	Lived there for almost 3 years, at the very back if it matters. I worked 2nd shift so coming home there were ALWAYS Police arresting people in the parking lot.  My car was almost stolen once even with an alarm on it??? Police Officer said it was probably crack heads who usually don't pay attention to alarms, he said they were rather fond of this parking lot...\n\nAlso had a cereall raplist make a guest appearance one night and try to break down the door of the single lady across from me who had just moved from Vermont or something-Imagine her Yelp story.... He was caught a month or so later which is why I'm privy to his cereal tendencies.\n\n\nWhen I first got the apt. it did seem like a good deal and figured I could put up with some things for the price. I had the black mold and other various issues as well but I was looking for a house so I was just buying time.\n\nThe reason for 1 star is the absolutely horrible customer relation skills-or lack there of. Of all the employees and especially management. Don't ever expect to get things taken care of in a timely manner and do expect attitude for even trying to get something fixed. If you ever have a problem you are seriously sol. I would check the be be be site on these guise before even attempting renting from here. \n\nEspecially for a single lady I would seriously avoid. One last thing, their maintenance guys are f;in creepy!!! I hated the fact these guys actually had a key to my apt. And I'd come home randomly and find them there for no apparent reason.	0
573	This is a great pub in the Newington area. There's an excellent selection of beer, a cool horseshoe bar, friendly staff and comfy seats to enjoy your tipple with. \n\nBest part? There is no music. You can actually come here, relax and have a conversation with your friends or colleagues. \n\nThe pub has a good atmosphere and despite its old man appearance there is a wide range of people that come to drink here. Cost wise, you're paying about average for a pint these days. Maybe \u00a33 odds for something like Tennants. A draft like Staropramen will probably set you back a bit more. \n\nOn another positive note, the ladies' loos are very nice. Always a bonus! I've been exploring the pubs in this area with my work nearby - this is one of the best so far.	3
574	Sunday night at Bank nightclub was amazing!   I really enjoyed myself.  When walking in the door man greeted us like we were VIPs.   When getting to out table we were greeted again by a beautiful cocktail waitress.  She took great care of me and my guests.   The music was awesome!  I would definitely go back!	4
575	What a menu! So many things to choose from. The open face turkey sandwich was delicious. It was just like eating a homemade Thanksgiving dinner. Clam chowder was also great.\nMy son has the cheesy cheese burger and fresh cut fries which he said was yummy.\nWe'll be back.	3
576	I suffered a major disappointment my first evening in Las Vegas.  \n\nDrai's no longer serves food.  \n\nI was led on all evening by stories of the delicious mac-n-cheese.  Having determinedly shaken my booty all evening to justify the caloric intake, it was a devastating surprise to discover my friend's favorite after-hours club no longer served the tasty treat.  In the showdown between smoking and food --- food lost.\n\nDrai's made up for the disappointment with a decidedly lush bordello-style interior, friendly bouncers, nice bartenders, strong mojitos AND free seats in which to rest my overworked feet.  It certainly helped that we were handed free entry coupons as we left the cab --- 'no cover' are two of the best words to hear together at a club.  \n\nThe music was more trippy/trancy than anything else, but that was perfect for the time of night.  The sparse crowd (we were there early for an after-hours club --- 2am) ran heavily to wannabe Euro-gigolos in big bug-eyed sunglasses but started to fill later with a cross section of late-night dwellers.  It seemed like the kind of place where anything goes and nobody really cares.  That's not quite as good as mac-n-cheese at 3am, but it comes close.	2
577	From the tastefully hand-lettered signage to the dim 19th-century de rigeur interior, I like this little spot sandwiched between Lawrence and Guillaume on Fairmount. This place makes a damn fine espresso and the donuts (orange w/ chocolate icing!) are meaty and delicious. The perfect spot for an afternoon pick-me-up or mid-day date. Love it.\n\nRating Scale:\n1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  \n2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?\n3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.\n4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.\n5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here.	4
578	I've been here twice first time we had poor service with dry cupcakes, second time we had the same with a different cupcake girl and I told myself never again! Today at a get together these were brought and once I tasted the dry cupcake and funky icing I knew it was from this place. Yep! I was right. 3rd times the charm for a review. Just nasty-	0
579	There really isn't much to say about a place like The Cheesecake Factory. It's chainey, has huge portions.... This particular location feels too large, like I felt like I was getting lost in my booth b/c the place was so large. \n\nThe food was on par with what I have come to expect from this chain, but it was the service that warrants the deduction in stars. Throughout our experience the service was fine- not particularly good, not particularly bad- but that all changed as we were getting ready to leave. \n\nI had asked for a box (b/c the portions are just too large here) and was in the process of placing my leftovers into said box when the waitress came back after running our credit card. As I still had my hand on my plate, picking at the last few fries that did not fit in the box, she swopped in and took the plate from me. Really???? This took a middle of the road experience and turned it sour.	1
580	Ok, so after a few visits to this place, I figured it's time to update my review. \n\nI don't classify myself as a Sushi connoisseur by any stretch, so I would say that doesn't qualify me too well to review this for people who are.  With that said, if you are new to sushi, and want to find what you like, this place is a good choice.\n\nI only wish I could get s steak with my sushi.  And maybe a baked potato and a salad.  :)	3
581	Golden Krust is a bakery first and their specialty is the patty, and other baked goods, they also serve Jamaican staples such as oxtails, fish, jerk chicken, and curry chicken with all the fixins(rice and peas, plantains, and veggies), Ting, and other Jamaican drinks. With that said, if you're looking for patties look no further because they're simply the best ever! Buttery, flaky, fat-laden pastry, filled with chicken, beef or shrimp! Yes, it is a chain and the patties are shipped in but they're baked in house daily and trust me they're addictive! \nNow, the food overall has been fresh and pretty solid, but over the years it has been a tad inconsistent, but everyone has a bad day so I haven't held that against them. I had my very first oxtail here several years ago and I've been ordering them ever since, but I must say my favorite is still the curry chicken. The oxtails and curry chicken are both seasoned just right with plenty of gravy.........it's all about the gravy. I know most people think of jerk chicken when coming to Jamaican restaurants but since I'm not a jerk type of chic, I can offer no insight on that entree:-) Golden Krust has been serving up solid Jamaican food in Charlotte for years and though there are other decent Caribbean spots in the city, I continue to return to the Krust.......	3
582	Hands down the best prime rib available, if the old saying is true you get what you pay for than this is quality at its finest, pricing is fair, about a hundred dollars for two with drinks, and they even bring the carving station to your table while the chef cuts the meat to your liking, all out great service.	4
583	I tried this restaurant due to it's proximity to hiking in the Superstitions.  We stopped by after a hike.  The only positive that I have is that the place looks nice and has a nice patio with a waterfall.  I ordered a green chili burro and my wife ordered beef tamales.  Several minutes after I placed my order the waiter came back to tell me they were out of green chili.  No biggie here but at a good restaurant I would expect the waiters to know if they were out of something this basic before the order went in.  \n\nI changed my order to green corn tamales.  When the waiter brought the order out he could not tell which plate had the beef tamales and which were green corn.  He takes the plates away for about 5 minutes to figure it out.  So we were teased with a preview of our meal only to be left hungry for 5 more minutes.  \n\nWhen he brought the plates back we discovered that they were both beef tamales.  I tasted one and it was hard, salty and not at all like any tamale I had ever had.  He took my plate and re-order my tamales.  It took too long for the re-order to come out.  My wife was pretty much finished by the time I got my plate.  She was disappointed in her meal but to starved to hold back from eating it.\n\nMy green corn tamales were better than the beef tamales but not good.  They smothered them with cheese and drenched the plate in a runny sauce.  The rice tasted like rice and tomato sauce and the beans were just straight up nasty.  I could not eat more than one bite.\n\nAs starving as I was from the hike I could not come close to finishing the plate.  I left still hungry.\n\nThe waiter, although friendly, did not offer any amends to the lack of green chili or the tamale mix-up.  \n\nI'll never go back to this place.  Overall this was the worst restaurant experience I have had in a long time.	0
584	Chicken cooked at wrong temperature... Was completely red. Threw up for 3-4 straight days. Lost business over it too. Fix the kitchen, fix the restaurant... STAY AWAY!	0
585	Amazing prime rib was so tender. The green beans are a must. The only downside was the price. $125 for the surf n turf!	3
586	The only reason I went into this shop was due to its slightly humorous name! Yes, it does not take a lot for me to venture into any new shop! \n\nInside, the shop is pretty small but very well stocked for all your stationary needs! I wasn't out to buy any pens but I somehow I ended up buying some, but they were not that expensive, actually they were on the cheap side. \n\nThe staff were friendly and quite chatty which adds to what is already I think I pretty good stationary shop! \n\nThis shop has everything you need to fill up your pencil case and you will then certainly be writing with the write stuff!	2
587	"I got the 190 octane with an extra shot. It tasted PHENOMENAL, and i could barely taste the liquor. I had already tossed back a couple shots doubting the true strength of this bad boy, thinking you are all pussies, but this put me and my buddies completely on our asses. We were doing backflips off of fire hydrants and having sword fights with our left over yard sticks which were then destroyed.\n\n I went to the MGM one, and holy god, at the price you pay, i would have to agree it is the best bang for your buck in Vegas in terms of liquor. The bartender was super friendly as well. Holy shit, when you \""unplug\"" that extra shot, be prepared to go to Shwastyville.\n\nEasily my go-to spot now when I'm in Vegas and wanting to get belligerent."	4
588	"Portions are made for giants here. Ordered the meatloaf hash, thought it could have been seasoned better, only ate about 1/10th of the 10\"" x10\"" 3 inch high skillet filled to the brim and then I couldn't even stand to look at it anymore. I highly recommend the Chicken and Waffles! The chicken was so moist and infused with rosemary, best fry chicken I've ever had. And the waffles are heavenly with a thick cut of bacon right inside! The waffles were substantial but yet fluffy, perfect texture. Everything comes together with a scallion glaze that's both savory and a little sweet, it goes perfectly with the waffle, bacon and fried chicken. No wonder it's the NYTimes favorite."	3
589	Definitely not worth the $35. It's decent as far as buffets go, hence two stars instead of one, but there are so many other places to eat where you won't get ripped off and have decent food.	1
590	Can whomever is in charge of parking for First Friday put down the bong? So I followed the advice on their website and went to the Old City Hall Parking Garage...which was empty! For free parking for First Friday I expected to see cars! And a shuttle! But no...only a handful of cars and not a shuttle to be seen...you gotta walk to El Cortez to catch a shuttle. And when you make it over there a 40 minute wait for a shuttle is routine. \n\nRather than write another chapter of War & Peace, here's the quickie version. \nParking: Not well thought out. At all. Quite frankly it sucks. \nShuttle: Pain in the rear to get to, cool as heck to ride, route they take makes no sense.  \nArt: Please show me some art! Paintings! Sketches! Not flea market crap I can find off an exit ramp along the Interstate in Arizona. ART!!!! LOCAL ARTISTS!!! If you have First Friday in the Arts District for Pete's sake have some dang ART!!!!\nFood Trucks: I wanted to check out SlidinThru and see if I could give them a second chance. The line made me say that's not going to happen. The food truck placement is working a bit too well to draw traffic. \nSecurity: When someone moves an art car and 8 LVMPD officers show up it might be a sign you're a bit overstaffed on security. \nLive Music: Thank you Skull Candy for headphones that work well as it drowned out the screech fest. Before I turned them on...what I heard was not good.\n\nIn short First Friday is slipping. And even with Zappos throwing money at it...it's not enough. The people running this just don't get it. Tony Hsieh and Co. would be better off paying to ship the FF leadership to other cities just once to see how it's done. \n\n1 Star: Because I regret wasting time to go to this one! It SERIOUSLY SUCKED.	0
591	Good food great prices!	2
592	Just ate here and will say it was pretty packed but we got seated in about 5 minutes. But it was packed and probably resulted in the poor and sloppy service we got.\n\nGot drinks at the bar and got seated and got special guac that had pomegranate arils in it. The pomegranate did add a nice splash of tang to the guac, only problem I had was that this tableside guac was 11 bucks and the server just used one of the prep bowls to combine everything; we ended up with a bowl with about two ice cream scoops worth of guac and Im trying not to exaggerate. For eleven bucks I should at least get a bowl bigger than what the onions and cilantro came in.\n\nNext was the queso fundido. At first glance we saw a small pool of water and grease so we decided to mix it thoroughly. The cheeses, onion, chorizo, and seasoning was on point, but half the dish was a watery pool and the other half was a stringy mess like pulling a slice off a good pizza: except this was supposed to be a dip. I was expecting a consistency of nacho cheese, where when you pull the chip off, the cheese falls in ribbons back to the tray, absorbing back into the mothership. My cousin said this might just be what queso fundido is, as we both never had it before. I don't know, you tell me, I honestly think that the cheeses weren't completely incorporated yet when they served it. \n\nI got the cochinita pibil tres tacos. The tortillas didn't taste heated up, and it ended up pretty starchy and grainy with the pork, which was seasoned with nice sour pickled veggies, but no sauce. Should've asked for hot sauce! The fries were okay, not really spicy, but the hot ketchup was good.\n\nMy cousin had a filet mignon torta and we first noticed that the bottom bun was soaked in the sauce which was slathered on part of the plate. So soggy bun and decent meat was going to be okkkkk, until we tasted that they didnt reduce the alcohol in the sauce enough and it was a real mismatch with the meat. :/ I'm sure it is a good sauce, had they weren't been so busy and overlooked our table.\n\nI am afraid to say that this socal boy tried to salvedge this meal by making my own dish: carnitas fries with salsa, pickled vegetables, and hot ketchup. I tried. Not sure if I'd go again given the chance, but I will say I'll eat that queso fundido again. Drunk.	1
593	Partying hard and hitting the tables at the Hard Rock last night got me in the mood for a taco. Having the Pink Taco on site was a perfect remedy. Collected my chips from the blackjack table as the sounds of Jimi Hendrix roared overhead and headed for the restaurant. \n\nEntering the place you can't help but notice the cool custom made low rider bicycles hanging from the ceiling, the funky star shaped lights draped over the bar area, and the modern Mexican - meets retro chic decor with all types of knick knacks, old radios, and items strategically strewn about. As the place was packed I went for seat at the bar and immediately ordered an ice cold Negra Modelo. What is terrific is that you get a free metal bucket of crunchy crispy tortilla chips with three different salsa's to dip into. This stuff is like crack when you are hungry and have been drinking! Lakers vs Spurs was playing on the bar tv's and rock music was blaring throughout. Yes, this is a man's paradise!\n\nStarted with the sweet corn tamales with pico and sour cream. Three tamales came on this plate and it was actually a good amount of food. Sweet and buttery corn flavored. Ordered the fish tacos baha style. Fish battered and lightly fried with serrano-cilantro salsa, shredded lettuce, sour cream, and pico de gallo. Refried beans and rice accompanied the meal. The fish tacos were very good, not the best I have ever had as I still have had better in NYC and CA, but tasty with just the right amount of batter and not over fried. I love refried beans too, and these were smooth goodness.\n\nMy one complaint is that they brought out my main plate a minute after I got the appetizer. I literally had to eat both at the same time. I hate when restaurants do that. Time management people in the kitchen! Learn it! \n\nOtherwise, a great place to go for a fun atmosphere and decent Tex-Mex food options. Rock On!	3
594	"They ruined my wife's birthday dinner.  Very slow service.  My son's steak tasted like sand (freezer burn?).  The waitress said that they are getting new steaks next week.  My daughter and I had the chicken - Dry ... She had a \""creamed corn\"" which means that the corn was in a \""biscuits and gravy sauce\"".  My wife had the oriental chicken salad - it was ok."	0
595	Finally tried Mon Ami Gabi after so many great recommendations and it is my new favorite restaurant!!!!!! The food is unbelievable and the atmosphere is beautiful!!!! I had the hanger steak with Merlot butter sauce and it literally melted in my mouth! My fiancee and my friend had the salmon which was delicious also, and my friend and I shared the escargot which is something you must try if you never have before! I cannot say enough about this place and just talking about it makes my mouth water! Get to Mon Ami Gabi as soon as you can and I promise it will not disappoint!!!!!!	4
596	Not worth the $ or the trip if you're driving to this establishment from outside of Tempe.\nI won't ever go to this place unless dragged here by a friend, and most of the time I won't even order anything other than a drink or maybe an appetizer. \n\nTo put it simply, this place has:\nA decent happy hour\nOkay service\nMediocre sushi\n\nJust go somewhere else.	1
597	Horrible stay. Decided to stay here after surgery to recover and relax. Awful beds! I slept worse here than in the hospital! Upgraded to a nicer room upon check in, but I reaped zero benefits from that. Called the front desk multiple times to get reg. coffee for the coffee maker and they told me that I needed to go to the restaurant if I wanted that. They never replaced the toilet paper in the room so i resorted to using kleenex. The hotel claims to be a 4 star establishment, but in actuality it is just a spoofed up motel. I will never stay here again and I am beyond disappointed by this establishment and the staff!	0
598	Worst experience ever.  We were here for two Saturdays (first Saturday about 11 people and 2nd Saturday 8 people) both times we did not get our food for almost 2 hours.  Our group was not the only one had the issue, we can see other parties complaining and yelling to the manager for the poor service,  but not all experience was bad though because the manager apologized for the issue, gave us a 100 dollar gift card and said our food are also free of charge.  I can't imagine how many parties they had to comp.\n\nThe food are good unfortunately the service are terrible when it comes to big parties.\n\nIt's not bad if you go on a small group but I would not recommend a party of more than 4 people, clearly they don't know how to handle large parties.	1
599	"I'm a cheapskate, so I moved pretty much everything I could on my own. But certain things were too heavy, so I called Champion Movers to take my washer/dryer and about 10 other pieces of bulky/unwieldy, heavy stuff.\n\nMy brother-in-law gave me all this advice as to how to protect myself from them scamming me (you know how some businesses like to take advantage of a \""helpless\"" woman). He advised me to disassemble as much as possible beforehand, so they couldn't drag ass unscrewing shit and force me to pay additional hours. He warned me that they might lollygag when wrapping stuff, also to pad their hours. He also cautioned that they might try and force me to pay for a 3-hour minimum.\n\nTo their credit, they did none of this!! They (Donny and Adrian) wasted little time wrapping, packing and loading my stuff, and everything was moved in exactly two hours (come to find out, they have a 2-hour minimum...so it worked out).\n\nThe only beef I had was, the dispatcher who took my initial call assured me they would be by on move day between 12-3pm, and would call 30 min prior to arrival. I figured 12-3 meant 3:15, so around 12 I was just getting ready to disassemble my bed and stuff, to make it easier (less expensive)...when they SHOWED UP, unannounced, at my front door at 12pm sharp!! \n\nI appreciated their timeliness, but a warning call would have been nice -- I was still in my PJs, and my nasty-ass old bong was still sitting out on my bedside table! Embarrassing!!!\n\nMy only other complaint was that they chipped one of the legs on my sofa...and didn't offer to credit me or anything. No big deal, though -- all in all, they were very cool and I would recommend them to anyone.\n\nDonny mentioned something in passing about a tip, so then I felt obligated to tip them $20 each...bringing my total to $240. Not unreasonable...but not really a super bargain. Still, all things considered, they were alllllll right :-)"	2
600	Probably the most terrible customer support I have ever encountered. after being berated by the office manager over the substance of my call I was then told in other words to go to hell. I will NEVER receive services here.	0
601	"I stayed at the Cosmopolitan for the first time in September this year. During my stay, I took in a show, shopped, dined, used their beauty salon and gambled all at this hotel. These were pleasant experiences. \n\nWith that said, I will never return to this hotel ever again. I would rather stay with Brace from \""Gigolos\"" than spend another penny at this hotel. The reason for this is because their finances and customer service are the worst I have ever experienced. \n\nIf you look at my other reviews you will see I am normally a reasonable person. I try to take things in stride but I think this hotel's customer \""service\"" has broken me. I only write this review to warn people: \n1 - Have $300 on your credit card available\n2 - Don't split or make any changes to the card, they can and will screw it up with no apologies\n3 - Upon check out, even if the lines are super long, wait and check out in person so you can have a physical copy and assurance you have been credited. \n\nI know I made some mistakes here but my overall frustration was with how terrible they handle their finances and the customer service is abysmal. All of my trust is lost with this place. I would have gladly referred my friends to this place if they hadn't been so awful after check-out.\n\n**Edited because this was long and whiney.\n***Double edit because Cosmopolitan FINALLY came through (not because of this review)"	1
602	The Breakfast Club really got me excited. I mean first of all it's named after a movie that I really love. Secondly it's pretty cute and the patio has those misters that are ubiquitous in Phoenix. But, the thing that really got my pulse racing was the idea of jalape\u00f1o biscuits and gravy. I've said over and over how I'm always looking for delicious biscuits and gravy and have such a hard time finding them. I thought I may have struck gold with the addition of jalape\u00f1os.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't. The meal was just okay. The thing that made it weird for me was that there was a layer of biscuits, then a layer of cheese, then the gravy which was topped with eggs. I like eggs, but usually on the side. I love cheese, but I really only wanted the gravy on the biscuits. \n\nOh well, each to his or her own. The place was cute, the servers friendly and I'd go back to try something else if I were back in town.	2
603	"Do not be lured in to this hotel by its cheap rates and \""newly remodeled\"" room pictures!!  \n\nMaybe some people will call me a hotel snob after reading my review. But when I spend money for a good night of sleep, I want to enjoy my sleep and not worry.\nPerhaps I stayed at the 5 stars hotel more then the regular 3 stars one in Vegas, but even a nice motel is better then staying here.\n\n2 1/2 stars for the room itself. Minus 1/2 stars for the disgusting, dirty parking structure and it's hallway to the casino. It's filthy and smelly. The Valet parking is totally on the other side of the building away from the casino and the hotel lobby! Kind of a long walk if you're carrying all those luggage.\n\nI hate jumping from hotel to hotel, but since we wanted to extend our stay in Vegas and wanted a more convenient location on the strip, we searched the Internet and thought we got this great deal for a newly remodeled room.\n\nTHE ROOMS: \nIt's like taking a 1980's hotel room and \""renovating\"" it by cover ups. The rooms are repainted and floors were redone, and new beds. That's only the best part.\nThey have new vinyl wooden floor, no carpet except a small rug in the walk way. (Which is a good things so it doesn't stink from the 30 year old carpet.. lol)\nThe furniture as of the table, night light table, and TV stand are all kind of banged up and so ready for a face lift!\n\nThe room itself is OK., but the tiny bathroom is where I draw the line. The door hinges and side panels were all old and rusty. They're mildew stain on the corners and white tiles inside the bath tub. It's clean but it's old and it's falling apart. The bathroom floor tiles were black and dingy, guess when they replaced the room's floor, they couldn't budget another 60 square feet of flooring in for bathroom, instead they rather gross out their guests.  They have nearly to none amenities. No slippers, not even coffee maker. Even the Motel 8 down the street has a coffee maker. They have an old wall burnt out hair dryer. I wouldn't risk it, because it looks like it's ready electrocute you when you turn it on.\n\nIf they did a remodeled, why didn't they just rip everything apart and replace it back with a everything new, this way, it really looks like they took the easy way out. Cover the stain up but not cleaning it out!! Although it may not be that bad, but thought of it, is kind of disgusting. There is no fan blower in the small tiny bathroom. So if any one have to go #2, make sure you buy a room spray for the bathroom. Without the bathroom fan, even when I take a shower, I have to leave the door with an open airway, or else I would suffocate in the hot steam.\n\nThe air conditioning is hell LOUD! If you're a light sleeper, make sure it's off! \nWe were in room 7084 and 7086 with a connecting door with old rusted door knob and chain. We had a great view of the strip right in front of the Caesar Palace fountain... It would have been so much prettier if the windows were clean. It was so disgusting and barely can see through the windows for the view.\n\nWould I stay here again?.. probably not unless I was desperate.. The parking structure and valet is very inconvenience. It's only idealistic to stay here if you go out walking from casino to casino. But we don't. We just drive around and when we get back to the Flamingo, we just stay at the hotel/ casino."	1
604	Not a huge fan of this Ross. If I'm in the area, I'll check it out but they aren't particularly well-stocked and their aisles are a bit on the messy side. \n\nFrom time to time I'll find a good buy, but for the most part I leave empty-handed. This is a rarity for me when I visit Ross. Definitely not one of the better options in town, but worth a stop from time to time.	1
605	"I rarely write negative reviews but I just had to for this company. What terrible service! They failed to show up on the first scheduled appointment & when I called they mysteriously \""lost\"" my information. When they did eventually clean our house I was not impressed at all. I'm not usually that particular when people clean my house but they did a terrible job. Mirrors & counters weren't cleaned well & they only cleaned one side of our sliding glass door. I could go on but will spare you. You get the idea. Save your time & money, don't use Pretty In Pink Cleaning. Is it too much to ask for a reliable & professional cleaning company!?"	0
606	Hello friends,\n\nIt's McDonalds!!! 24hr. I can't validate any other reviews. Everyone seems on point when I come here. But that just may be my great smile and personality. Who knows.\n \nBut it serves its purpose.\n\nFree Wi-Fi\n\nTTFN	2
607	"I am not a Thai Restaurant expert I have eaten at several all have been slightly different in the taste of the food. There will always be disagreements as to how it should taste. As I have said many times before I do know what tastes good \""to me\"".\n\nThis was my second visit. Do not remember what I had the first time except it was good and the service was excellent. Act sincerely glad you are there to eat. \nThe second visit I had the Ginger #10 on the menu with pork. If you like ginger this meal was excellent. I will remember a long time the taste of that first bite. This is a must try if you have not already. It had been several weeks since I was there last time. The staff recognized I had eaten there before and came out to say they were glad I had chosen them for lunch. Made me feel special. \n\nYou are greeted with a bowl of soup. Both times before I had received a menu to order. I thought this was a very nice touch. The dishes are generous in proportion. There is always much more than I can or should eat. Two people could easy eat off one dish and be fine. Better yet take three people order two different meals and share. \nDecor is pretty much oriental. Not much to say but it is appealing and appropriate for a Thai Restaurant. Very neat and clean, clean. Quite and low lighting. \nWill I go back. Yes I am planning on doing so next week. \n\nMy rating is a four not because I did not get a excellent meal or service. I do not give out 5's easily as I used to. One more trip that was good as the first two and I will revise this to 5 stars. \n\nGive them a try."	3
608	--lost its traditional feel through the remodel. where has the personality gone?\n--bulky dark wooden chairs need cushions, the whole place needs more fabric. great potential with lots of light and high ceilings. More bright mexican ceramics please. stark wall of crosses and exposed wood and wrought iron takes me straight to Nathan Lane's Birdcage apartment. LOL.\n--remodel great for small (150ppl) wedding parties with dance floor in the center of the room.\n\n--rice dry and unflavorful, no savor. beans again with no flavor.\n--table salsa is canned tomato sauce with pepper seeds and BASIL and the touch of sugar you get from Ragu! It's salsa, not marinara, people!\n--guacamole has cottage cheese as a thickener! ew!\n--chili colorado is just thick, no flavor.\n--service is slow and unhelpful, but prices are high high.\n--$9 for the cheese crisp is worth it. great crispiness and good cheese blend.	1
609	I have not had a single bad visit to this barbershop. The staff has been always nice, friendly, and provides a good haircut.\n\nI usually get the Triple Play which is a cut, shampoo and hot towel. Not a bad place to go if you're looking for a new barbershop.	4
610	Worst experience I've had with a business. You would think reserving a car a week in advance would have a car waiting for you at the place you made the reservation for. Well you would be very wrong. \n\nI came in with my reservation that I PREPAID reservation and while I was waiting in like a lady comes out and says the have no more cars and doesn't explain anything. I actually had to ask what I was supposed to do with my prepaid reservation and she tells me that my card was not charged and that I should go to the airport to get a car...OK... So does the airport have a car available before I drive all the way over there. Well that was too much to ask because they don't know and they can't get a hold of them.\n\nOh and apparently their website it not run by Hertz so they have no control over reservations and cannot guarantee you will have a car waiting for you. So if you absolutely need to rent a car do not go with Hertz.	0
611	Awful!  I understand AZ casinos are not like Vegas casinos, but this place was just terrible.  I expected so much more out of a brand new casino.  It was small and felt cramped in every aspect.  The cigarette smoke was unbearable and offensive.  The staff was extremely rude, and everything is hard to find.  The drinks are expensive and the bartenders are horrible - rude and extremely slow.  \n\nI wrote in about our terrible experience... I got a voice mail, and have tried five times now to get back in touch with the guy, to no avail.  They show that they don't care about their customers in any way, so I recommend you waste your money elsewhere... that's what I'll be doing!	0
612	Thank you so much for helping out with a surprise for my fiance's and NOW wife's 30th birthday as we were out in Phoenix for our wedding. I would have given 5 stars however the cupcakes for St. Patrick's day mixed with alcohol were not very good. However the variety of cupcakes they had were 2nd to none and the birthday cake cupcake was more than filling. They say it only serves 9 but it fed 11 with LOTS of extras...so THANK YOU for making it a part of my breakfast for the rest of the week lol. A definite visit when in Phoenix!!!	3
613	Pretty good hot dogs. I've been here a few times and the boston dog has a bit of a sweet and savory taste to it. The mac n cheese in the mac n cheese dog is very bland tasing though, I ended up scooping it off of my hot dog. The prices are pretty high too. The bread is definitely the best thing here.\nThey've also been closed at random times when they should've been open too... Out of the ten times I've tried to go here in the last month or so they were only open three times for some reason...	2
614	"went to this place last week and was really disappointed! i should have listened to the previous reviews. the oysters were not fresh, the so called  \""lobster tails\"" was a major disappointment, a shrimp would have more meat in them. but what puzzled me was that it is a seafood buffet but nothing special about their seafoods, the other buffet in rio offers most of the dishes for a cheaper price. will not return here anymore."	0
615	One of my fave clubs in Vegas.  They always have great DJs performing.  Gets mega crowded but you can always hang around the pool area if you want more room and a place to breathe.	3
616	The worst experience of my life at a restaurant !!!!!  Not only they took for ever to bring us food, the tapas were cold and all tasted the same. The paella never arrived, but the worst was when one of the waiters, banged my dad's head pretty hard and didn't even care to make sure he was ok!,,,the manager with a stupid smile on his face didn't do any better.\nOver all my worst ever specially with their over priced food!!!!	0
617	I love it.  Point blank.  I came for my birthday on a 3 night comp... my room was gorgeous, the bathroom was fit for a queen, and the service was excellent.  Only one incident came up with room service taking over an hour, but to make up for it they took care of the bill.  The pool is to die for.  I wish I was still laying out having pitchers of mojitas delivered to me by bronze godesses... :(  so sad.  I miss you Caesars!	4
618	Lived here for a year. Looks cool from the outs\u00eede and walking around that's it.  It was terrible loud herd everything and everyone in halls above and under you.                                I had not one but two bikes stolen from there and my girlfriend had one stolen.   Maintenance was bad I had leaks in my ceiling one from rain water.  Then one from the guys shower above me. Maintenance!!!! They were not prompt at all left a huge mess in my apartment after many trips to the office asking when will this be fixed.  For the price that you pay there don't do it.  Lucky for me  I traveled  a lot when I lived there.  I pity for those who have to live there all year.	0
619	The food was not only fresh and amazing, but the service was 10 star worthy! Our server Matt went above and beyond and above again to make sure our experience was top notch!	4
620	Seeing how little went into my quesadilla, I'm not comfortable with paying over $7. At least use a mixed cheese blend!  And seeing how little effort went into making my quesadilla, I am really not impressed (you would think a labor charge is rolled into the price of food.)\n\nMaybe what distinguishes Qdoba are the burritos with their special combos, but I am nonplussed to try them again. Oh well.	1
621	Literally the best. \n\nAlways have free samples and are willing to skewer just about everything they own on a toothpick for you to try.\n\nThis is a good first step if you dream of having a good relationship with a butcher like all those TV chefs do.	4
622	"I ordered these boozy lush gems for our destination-elopement weddingmoon babymoon ummm... Any other trendy words I need to insert here?  Anyway, ordered a dozen cupcakes sent straight to my hotel front desk.  The process of payment and setting up delivery and flavor choices was done swiftly.  Everything went well, and as I paid over the phone, I had to power down my ubiquitous Apple product as we were now taxiing down the Tarmac. \n\nMonday morning I receive an email. The cupcakes have arrived!  I was told to go grab them lest they melt in the punishing heat of Vegas.  So we hopped out of the pool and fetched these heavenly things before we were off to the spa at the venetian.  \n\nI got Marilyn Monroe, an amazing banana flavor spiked with vodka; Better Than Sex, a raspberry white cake deal that was supposed to be spiked but didn't have even a moist center; and Bailey's Wet Surprise.. The true winner here.  Dark wet chocolate cake injected with a sexy burn.  The kind of boozy bite that warms the gullet.  Vegas perfect.  This was GOOD.  \n\nUnfortunately we couldn't finish the raspberry-topped ones as mold quickly set in on those treats.  There were only four of us so we ate them as quickly as possible however and did keep them in a fridge. \n\nThey were amazingly delicious and so fun for my wedding \""cake.\""  The price was a little crazy but that's Vegas.  A dozen smaller cupcakes (very light on the frosting) in three flavors delivered to your hotel will cost you around $59.  Gulp.  But they were so dang yummy and welcome to \""come home to\"" after a long night on the Strip."	3
623	"Over easy is great concept that is not managed well, The restaurant is cozy (small) with good ambience. Our wait for the two time we have gone has been 30-45 minutes after being told 20 minutes. The food is good and the service is fair. \n\nOur last experience: waited one hour for a table after our initial 20 minute wait time, ordered a special not on the menu and it was given to the table next to us (literally an elbow away), they took a bite before the waitress came over and said, oh you have the wrong dish and tried to hand it over to us. Obviously, i asked for  redo since someone else had allready taken a bite of it. 20 minutes later as i hungrily watched my boyfriend eat his meal mine arrived, it was excellent. when the bill arrived we asked for a compensation since it was their error and our waitress says \""but you ate it'. seriously???\non the redeeming side: the manager took it off, no questions asked. \n\nI will not be returning to overeasy unless i have 3 hours to spend on a sunday afternoon waiting for breakfast."	1
624	"Let me start by saying I'm no authentic German food expert at all.  So I don't know how authentic the dishes are.  I like the food pretty well.  Have gone there multiple times.  Love their German potato salad and red cabbage.  \n\nThat being said, they get only 3 stars because they are way over priced (go during 2 for 1) for \""doctored\"" dishes.  I asked if they make the potato salad and cabbage from scratch and was told no, that it would take too much preptime and that the cook \""doctors\"" them from premade.  Also our desert was frozen and had to be heated, so not fresh there.  For the prices they ask, they should take the time to prep food from scratch.  But I do still like the taste, they doctor well to me.\n\nAlso, our last visit the table clothes under glass top were dirty and our waitress was rudish and rushing us."	2
625	I'm a little surprised that no one else Yelping in this area has stumbled upon ZBA, especially considering that there isn't really much else like it in the 28105.  Looks like it's up to me to get things started!\n\nZBA is a little international grocery right on the corner of Independence and Sam Newell in Matthews. As I said, it's pretty unique for the area.  It's small but there's a lot of stuff packed into it.  The majority of what ZBA carries is Middle Eastern (of the Sadaf brand), but there's a random smattering of European and Asian items, as well as some pretty mundane items such as Coke, toiletries, and auto supplies (!).\n\nI struggled with myself over whether ZBA deserved 3 stars or 4 stars.  On one hand, the prices are good (usually, but not always, cheaper that Harris Teeter's ethnic section), and the owner is truly friendly and helpful.  On the other hand, the stock is kind of haphazard and unfocused.   I think ZBA would greatly benefit from concentrating in one area and discarding the American and non-food items.  After all, it is sandwiched between the Matthews and North Sardis HTs, with a Pep Boys and Sams Club on either side of the road as well.  This space could be used to carry a wider range of the unique items that one can't really get elsewhere in Matthews.\n\nHowever--and please heed this part of my review if no other--ZBA is worth a trip if only for the GREAT prices on their wide variety of dried spices.  Seriously.  You can get  good-sized bags of spices for as little as 99 cents each.  The deals are so good that ZBA has become my first stop whenever I need to replenish my spice rack or need something for a new culinary endeavor.  Their tahini is also sold for significantly less than you'll find it at a generic supermarket.  \n\nDrop by and give ZBA a chance.  They do have some truly good deals, despite the clutter.  And hey, you could always pick up some Armor All with that tub of tumeric.	2
626	This place is the definition of a flea bag hotel. The person who took the pics on the choice website should be both charged w/fraud and given a raise by hotel management as the room I was in and the lobby look NOTHING as pictured. They are supposedly renovating the place, but goodness knows when that will happen. The place might have been nice when it was built in the 70s, but its glory days are long gone. It also has a super weird layout.\n\nMy room was two doubles because they were out of kings and thankfully I only needed the one bed because the other was completely stripped down to the mattress w/the bedding laying on top of the dresser. I called down to the front desk to be put in another room, but the place was full, which shocked me, but apparently their core business is airline employees.\n\nNeedless to say I the place just felt dirty and I was afraid to touch anything in my room. Sleeping in the bed was agony because I had ideas of bedbugs running through my head.\n\nThe only reason this place is getting 1-star is because they had a decent bfast and the girl at check in was nice, as was the shuttle driver, however the other girl who answered the phone needs to take a customer service and attitude adjustment refresher course!\n\nEither way, steer clear of this pit!	0
627	Midway into the show, I realized I was at the David Copperfield MAGIC show not a comedy show. D.C's attempt at being funny was pathetic. AND I was seated in front of the speaker and each time when he was done was a trick a man would scream, yaaa and whistle hella loud. How lame is it when you have to have a recorded person cheering you on and to play the same thing about 20x's as if people are really that dumb to notice it's a recording. I agree with all the other reviews that the 10 minutes or so segment of his career was very self absorbent on his part. Ok we get it. You're a famous magician.\n\n\nI would not put it past him if the audience chosen to be part of the magic tricks were planted. Everything just seem fake and super cheesy!	1
628	"Very pleased with Caitlin's Tender Love & Pet Care! It gave me great peace of mind to know that Kobe was at a \""home away from home\"" for the weekend instead of locked up in a kennel all day. He was given attention, played with dogs all day, and even slept on the bed. Caitlin is understanding and very easy to talk to. Kobe is pretty easy going but as a puppy still has some faults -- she was wonderful with working with Kobe. She even provided a \""While You Were Gone\"" information sheet after picking Kobe up going over his day-to-day activities. I will definitely be using Caitlin's Tender Love & Pet Care again! More cities need to have a wonderful business like this!\n\nI also want to add that Kobe's breed -- Shiba Inu -- usually leaves him reserved around strangers, however there are certain people he immediately bonds with (I like to refer to them as \""good hearted people\"") and Kobe loved and trusted Caitlin from the start!\n\nThanks again Caitlin!"	4
629	Came here on a recommendation of a friend, and for a bachelor party, and let me tell you I wasn't disappointed! \n The gals are friendly and not pushy. Bottle service is a good way to go. \n And the funny thing was they weren't gonna let me in since I was wearing a wifebeater, but they let me buy one of their t-shirts($20) to put over it, and they let us all in for free!!!\n And all the gals are pretty attractive.	2
630	This was my first experience at a dive sushi bar.  I saw the parking lot was full, which is normally a good sign.  All the cars were for the gym next door.  There were a group of sorority girls for me to look at, but otherwise shotty decor.  Bathroom was nasty.  Miso soup was edible but the rice in my main dish tasted like it was a few days old.  I didn't try the sushi, there are other places similar but better very close by.	0
631	I went here a few years ago. The staff was so rude to me and stand-offish to both my friend and I that I refuse to go back. I've heard that because of the bad economy they have since had to lay off the entire staff. Maybe now that they're desperate, they'll be nicer to potential customers. Either way, I still won't go back.	0
632	This is the perfect place to go on a Sunday to watch all the football games, they have tv screens everywhere!! With each screen playing a different game, along with games playing they are also showing horse races. I never knew such a place existed until we drive by and my dad wanted us to come here so he could bet on the games.\n\nPeople bet big money on these games and horse races, it's crazy. It feels like you are watching the games with a bunch of friends, everyone here is decked out in their team gear and slapping five or striking up convos with people who share interest in the same teams. \n\nThey offer cheap food and cheap beer, there are people walking around with buckets of beer, not sure if they do this everyday or just game day. It can get extremely crowded so prepare for all the people. This is a great place for sports fanatics that don't want to miss any games and want to have a good time while doing so.	2
633	"Typically, I would shy away from writing a review on a fast food chain with 290 locations. However, the In-N-Out experience is anything but the normal fast food dining experience. I am always impressed by the consistency of the In-N-Out Burger experience. \n\nThe quality of their never frozen beef patties and fresh, made-to-order burgers is excellent and their customer service is always prompt, efficient, and wonderful. The staff is always courteous and happy--it's good to know that I am supporting a place that seems to treat their employees well. \n\nThe inexpensive burgers and fries always hit the spot--I only wish there were locations outside of California and the Southwest to satisfy my fast food burger cravings. But, I suppose staying within a manageable driving distance of the distribution centers is what keeps the food high-quality, fresh, and preservative-free.\n\nMy go-to is the protein style double double burger (no bun, just a hearty lettuce wrap around patties that are oozing with cheesy goodness).  When I want to try a variation on my favorite, I just consult the \""Not-So-Secret\"" menu on the In-N-Out website! \n\nIf you have not been to an In-N-Out burger, I strongly recommend visiting this wonderful fast food place! Expect a long line and short wait, but if you are a fast food/burger lover, you will not be disappointed!\n\nFun tidbit: Look for the bible verse references on the paper products. Just noticed this after my umpteenth visit to In-N-Out Burger!"	4
634	"I am expressing my great DISAPPOINTMENT with the service I received from The District in October 2009.  \n\nIn the beginning of October, I approached The District to see if it would be possible to bring about 70 to 100 people on a Thursday night at around 10:30 p.m..  Not only did they say it would be great, they would have drink specials and have the happy hour menu available to our guests. And also, the manager had told me and another colleague there's hardly any business on Thursday, so it was great to have an organization interested in having a mixer at The District.  Thursday night came, the level of customer service and professionalism that the manager gave us was HORRIBLE!  The way he treated me, others and the fact that we brought about 70 to 100 people there itself was definitely something to remember.  NOT only did they lie about accommodating our large group obviously The District could not do so, nor did the management team care to do so.   The place was already crowded with other guests which is great for them HOWEVER, the manager never tried to accommodate all our guests which they knew we were coming! ...for seating, passing out menus..the only way people were able to order if they were seated which they couldn't,  some individuals were waiting a very long time for a drink that cost $15, there were no drink specials besides the beer and possibly the wine, I never I saw the menu, but I do know people were not happy with purchasing a tiny drink for $15 a pop! The manager did speak to another individual with my guests at one point and had told him, individuals can not get drink specials at the bar, however, there was nowhere to sit , the majority of the tables were already pre occupied.   Also, the executive director of the non profit organization that I work for had ordered just a Dr. Pepper, he gave the bartender a $20, received the drink and never received his change, when he asked the bartender, the bartender took his name down and did not give him his change.  HE HAS YET TO RECEIVE HIS CHANGE FOR A DR. PEPPER.  \n\nI never received a thank you for bringing people to The District that night.  IT WAS VERY DISORGANIZED AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL TEAM AT THE DISTRICT.  \nAlso, the manager had said to me and the executive director  that we would receive free valet parking since we were at The District, we had to pay over $40 for parking.   It was a very frustrating night.\n \nBottom line, we truly did not feel welcome at The District.  I was put in the predicament where I had to clear up confusions and make my guests feel welcomed.  At one point had considered having a kickoff party and/or mixers at The District, bringing over 100+ guests, but after the customer service/treatment everyone received from the management team and wait staff, I am now reconsidering ever utilizing The District and the Sheraton. As for myself, I was very disappointed and had expected great service.\nTHIS IS THE FUNNY PART!  I did receive (a week later) an email from Heinrich Stasiuk, District GM.  Very insincere apology, THE FUNNY PART...he attached the email to the ongoing inside conversation between the managers stating I was difficult (sorry but you promise me certain things, should be able to keep it!) also stated in the email \""but they made good money from us\"" .if you are a business or non profit organization trying to find a place to hold your mixer or dinners, I hope either you reconsider or let them know you've read my review!  Since I was difficult, I'm sure they will remember me and the fact they probably made about $3000+ off of my guests."	0
635	Came here after a overly busy Butcher and the Rye.  Wow.....and what a relief.  This was exactly what I wanted.  Easy to hear yourself talk and outstanding drinks.  I had the Egg Flip as well as the Orange/Lemon Old Tom Cobbler.  Both great.  The Cobbler tasted so refreshing it would have been a great beach drink.  We also got a Charcuterie board which was good, but wasn't a fan of the Pate (and I usually like Pate)  I never knew this place existed until my friend showed it to me.  I'm so glad I know about it now.  I feel like I'm giving up this secret gem.  A place for great drinks and conversation.	3
636	Cocktails with friends at 5:30. Live music (nice) but WAY too loud. More appropriate for late night. \nAlso, BEWARE....there are no bathrooms, despite having more than 250 seats. \nMgt. says since they don't serve food they don't need bathrooms.  Really stupid....won't be back.	0
637	"For my birthday all I wanted to do was go to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  I bought a new dress and was very excited.  My boyfriend and I did a little gambling and day drinking before dinner and his stomach wasn't doing the best.  So we sit down to our table and the waiter was pompous.  He took our drink order, I got champagne and my boyfriend (not feeling the best) got water.  The waiter looked at him in shock and said, \""you know you can order a drink, I didn't ask for I.D.\""  My jaw hit the freaking floor.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  First off, he is well above the drinking age and I.D. is irrelevant.  Second, he is a grown man and can order for himself.  Thirdly, what if he were an alcoholic and couldn't drink.  So right off the bat we start off on the wrong foot.  So our drinks come and a bus boy brings me a water that has a bug in it.  I call the waiter over and say, \""I'm sorry, but there is a bug in my drink\"".  The waiter takes the glass and doesn't say a word, not a sorry, nothing.  Immediately he comes back with water.  Because of his attitude and the quickness that he brought the water back, I am assuming he didn't pour me a new glass but just flicked the bug out of the water.  I address this with the waiter and tell him that I want the check and I want to leave.  He calls the manager over and I tell her everything that has happened.  She offers to start over, but by that time my night was ruined.  I looked at her and said, if you guys can't get my water right, how can I trust you to get my meal right?!?.  So, now everything is booked for dinner for Memorial Day and we went to Benihanna's because they could take us\nUPDATE - A manager contacted me shortly after I wrote this review.  He not only made me feel better about the experience but went above and beyond to correct it.  That is customer service I can get behind.  Mistakes happen, and the staff truly represents the restaurant however one bad apple shouldn't spoil the bunch, especially when I see all the nice reviews of this restaurant"	2
638	I had lunch today at this joint with family... My sis-in law, big fan of this place and makes it a point to stop here when she is in town...  The place is not very big at all but the line was out the door...  I ordered the mixed plate.. I thought it was ok,,, it included a beef, chicken and some fish... The beef though in sauce did not have much taste,,, the chicken was good, i liked it.. tender and moist, it was de-boned thigh,, the fish was ehh,,, rather had extra chicken.. The portion was large, too large for me to finish...  I will try the Mami or Udon noodles next time....  I hesitantly recommend this place... I would eat here again but i wont make a special trip....  Hope this helps	1
639	Der 22.September 2012 sollte unser Hochzeitstag werden! Eigentlich hatten wir schon eine Location\nf\u00fcr unsere Hochzeit gefunden aber als wir selber G\u00e4ste bei einer Hochzeit im Pflug waren, haben\nwir uns nochmal umentschieden. Es war eine gute Entscheidung im Pflug unsere Hochzeit zu feiern!\nUnseren ca. 60 G\u00e4sten hat es allen sehr gut gefallen im Pflug. Das Essen war sehr lecker, es\ngibt eine gute Bierauswahl (das war wichtig weil viele Bayern zur Hochzeit geladen waren) und der\nService war auch einfach nur super. (Und das alles f\u00fcr einen guten Preis!)\nDas tolle bei privaten Feiern im Pflug ist, dass alles so unkompliziert ist. Egal welche W\u00fcnsche\nwir hatten, man konnte uns alles erf\u00fcllen. Im Pflug gibt es eine Musikanlage und einen Beamer\ndie genutz werden d\u00fcrfen, was wir auch gemacht haben. \nEs hat uns und unseren G\u00e4sten sehr gut gefallen und wir wollen uns alle beim Pflug-Team f\u00fcr\nunsere gelungene Hochzeit bedanken! \nSolle mal wieder eine Feier anfallen, wissen wir wo wir hingehen werden ;-)\nLiebe Gr\u00fc\u00dfe Anna & Christian	4
640	Way better than what I expected!  It's three floors of conspiracy, blood and bootlegging.  Parts of it are graphic so if you're squeamish, you may want to pass on the crime scene photos.  It could not be in a more apropos location than Vegas.  \n\nI got $2 off for checking in with Yelp.  It's a nice distraction from the casinos.	4
641	Similar to El Torrito chain in Southern California, Cantina Laredo is fancied up Mexican food at a quality restaurant price. I had an appetizer, cannot recall the name but had three items, that was very good. A nice place to go for a sit down dinner date, for value I would go to Habanero's.	2
642	Okay now Thanksgiving has come and gone for 2014. I really love fresh pressed apple cider. Not that stuff they call cider in the supermarkets. That still looks and taste like apple juice. The only place I could find pressed cider was at Walmart. Now they do not have anymore. Does anyone know where I can buy fresh pressed cider in Las Vegas ? I have tried to figure out when Gilcrease farm is open. But no luck with that because of their weird hours. And it looks like they are closed for the holiday during December. This would be the perfect time of the year for them to sell their fresh pressed cider. If anyone has any info where it's sold I'd be greatful. Happy Holidays to all.	0
643	I love Herb & Rye. I like the dark decor and last time i was there on a friday night they had a DJ in there as well.  Aviation is my favorite drink there and i don't normally leave the bar without at least three of them ;)\n\nThe food is also great there, i like the wings (hot & sweet & crispy, YUM), beef carpaccio, mussels, and the steak actually tastes good here.  Definitely order it during their happy hours, really worth it :)	4
644	I actually wanted to give it one star, but I'll give it two for, well, not really sure... maybe because I'm comparing it to AT&T Park, so Chase is really up against it.\n\nThe sight-lines are fine, and the pool looks/ seems like a nice spot. Food options pretty much sucked. Got the garlic fries there, and, well, it's not fair to their vendor at Chase, but they were just so-so. Beer selection was kind of lacking. Not many vendors accepted credit cards, so you better go loaded with cash.\n\nIf you're a fan of the visiting team, there are, literally, NO options to buy any of your teams' gear. At AT&T, they would at least have a few hats and other options for the visiting team (not so myopic as AZ, apparently). \n\nIt appears they might have some kind of light rail to get to the games, but not that apparent and available in a pretty small area. The neighborhood itself was not exactly the best. We had to drive past a Circle K on the way back to the 10, and there were about 300 people milling outside on Friday night... looked like a riot was about to break out.\n\nOh yeah, they apparently closed the roof a little late on Friday, so it was still like 88 degrees and really humid (not the dry heat like outside). Everyone (fans and players looked uncomfortable... might explain the deuchiness of the Dback fans on Friday... wow!).\n\nI wouldn't go to a game there again. I'd rather stay poolside, have a drink and catch the game on TV.	1
645	Noodle hut is unpretentious. You get what you pay for.\n\nYou can eat in if you absolutely have to. But except after an evening of drinking with friends i really can't think of a reason to stay in with such a spartan decoration.\n\nThe food is decent. Nothing high end. But for a $6-10 dollar meal you can't expect a quisine menu. But ingredients are fresh, and it's prepared on the spot in a clean workplace.\nPortions are very reasonable. And you get a free soda with the specials.\n\nDefinitly one of my favorite take-out places.	2
646	I'm an avid shopper at Ulta. Every time I've come in here to look, etc. employees are rude and on top of me the entire time. The reason it deserves one star is because I was here before Christmas a few years ago with my mom (shopping for my daughter) and I had a police man usher me and two other women to the back of the store. They made us empty our pockets, purses, etc. and we're extremely rude to all of us. They accused us all of being in cahoots with each other and planning to shoplift... I'd never even seen the women before! I was shaken up and very upset. But still very polite to manager and said I understood she was just looking out for the store and she was unbelievably rude and brushed me aside instead apologizing greatly, as she should have. Little did she know I was probably going to spend 100$+ on Christmas gifts! Very unfortunate because two or three of the girls here are angels and amazing helpers.	0
647	I really like La Condesa.  What stands out is the variety of fresh salsas on their salsa bar, and the great variety of tacos to choose from. I've had the shrimp, and a couple of different versions of their steak tacos.  I've also had the mole chicken, which was great as well.\n\nService can be a little sketchy here, mostly because they're often very busy.  But if you're in the area, it's a great place to try.	3
648	Jay, gave me the worst service, ever! He reached across a couple of our guests to serve drinks and when he finally got around to taking our dinner order, at his leisure. All of our drinks were empty, and that didn't seem to bother him either. And amidst him taking the time out of his busy schedule to take our order( with 3 other tables in the place), he proceeds to tap his hand on his crossed arms. One of our group mentioned that we must have pissed off the waiter.  Steaks, tough! Feel free to check out my other reviews. I am never negative about restaurants, but this one took the cake. The only reason it was given 3 stars was because of the atmosphere. So if tou dont care about the food being good, or the service being worth a darn, well this is your kind of place!!	2
649	Indian is probably my most favorite cuisine next to Thai and this place was okay.  I was very excited about it based on the reviews.  The service was good.  They were out of veggie samosas.  The chicken tikka masala was okay.   The naan was good, but I have enjoyed it much more at some of my favorite spots. I think I was most disappointed in the chicken masala.  The sauce (very watery and thin) was not as thick as I like and  that.  It was missing some rich flavors I am used to at other Indian restaurants.  The lentil soup was good and the salad was okay.	2
650	This is a fabulous place to go when you have been induced with medical supplements while undergoing tests! After spending the majority of the day at Mayo Clinic, my girlfriends and I ventured here for some well-needed nourishment. The fasting thing does not work well for me! In my drug induced state, I ate all 6 pickles, yep ate them all and boy were they tasty as ever. And then I ordered a liverwurst sandwich with onions and cheese on rye bread! Really? Yes, really. And it was superb! Let's just say the entire experience is but a blurrrrrrr, but the service was good, fast, and the food amazing. Then I needed some dessert! The fridge is full of lots of goodies. Now that I am coherent again, I just shake my head and help myself to some rugallah every time I pass through the kitchen. OH WELL, I deserve a little reward for all I have been through today! :)	3
651	We spent New Years Eve here! Great atmosphere, excellent food and friendly staff!	4
652	This was the first time I ate here. While the food was alright, the service sucked...and I even ordered take out! I order the Panang Curry and rice enough for 3 ppl when I placed my order. However, when I got my food I asked for hot sauce and the manager gave me 1 tiny cup of hot sauce so I asked for 2 more. He made a face and said he can only give me enough for 1 person and that any more would cost extra. (are you kidding me??...this is Thai food we're talking about. it's supposed to be spicy). He said $1 for each addl hot sauce. Rude customer service, wont be going back here.	0
653	If you need a post office that's open late, this one is open the latest.\n\nCan't tell you how many times I've tried to find a post office that's open later than the one in my neighborhood until I discovered this one.  It's on Sunset, right across the street from McCarran Airport, is open till 9pm Monday-Friday and 4pm on Saturdays.  As much as I like my local office (Silverado) for convenience, this one seems to be the go to place if you don't want an overwhelmed staff and want to get in and out in a relatively efficient amount of time.  They also do passport stuff in case you need to get that taken care of.\n\nHowever, being the main post office in Las Vegas, it does have a big of a huge warehouse type feel to it.  Almost think the ambiance of a Costco with envelopes in place of food samples.  Also, despite the extended hours, the overnight shipping deadline is relatively early.  3:30pm.  I've been to other post offices where the deadline has been closer to 5pm... so that's something you gotta keep in mind.  Also, if you're coming from South Strip and/or the Henderson area, it's probably easier to access this place by heading north on Paradise.  It's right there on your right as the street ends rather than dealing with traffic on Sunset.	2
654	Came in super late for some munchies and to cure our sweet tooth. I got the bread pudding and my friend got the french toast. The food was solid, but the service was less than desirable. The bartender was more concerned with her phone and gossip than being personable to us.	2
655	I got the #11 pho with any desired topping to choose. The beef broth was good! The bowl was large and worth the $8.50! BUT I found 2 strands of hair in it!!!! And another 1 in my mouth.... I didn't want to tell the worker but I should've. The servers were nice and the food was good, so I felt bad if I complained to them.	2
656	Shucks..a bit disappointed, last night I took family for the first time hoping to have the same experience as we did for about 10 times. The Clam Bake was the reason we always go on a Sat to have the $5 off, found that it wasn't anymore...crabs was an added option and you had to pay extra for it. It was still tasty but we should have gone to a buffet for the price we paid...It was still tasty though...Sadly..Shucks is now not on the top of my list..for value as the prices went up immensely...	1
657	The tournaments and table games offered aren't overly diverse, but they have pretty typical limit/NL hold'em choices. The room is really small compared to other popular poker rooms in Vegas, but TI's is clean and the staff is friendly. And there's a margarita bar about thirty feet away in case your bad beat drives you to drink (like mine did...)	3
658	My bf and I wanted to eat at the buffet at Ceaser's but his friends wanted to come here so we ended up here . This buffet is pretty pricey .. around $30 per person . There's all kinds of food - Mexican , Italian , Chinese , Soups , Salads , Seafood , Desserts , American , Mediterranean . Of course , the most expensive and worthwhile is the seafood so of course you would load up on seafood . However , there is a long line and a very little and poor selection of seafood . The American and dessert selection wasn't that great . The Italian selection was pretty good though . The food was decent , but not that great . I don't think it's worth your money . There was a bald waiter that worked here that my bf and I thought was very friendly .. he kept smiling and was very attentive even when he was busy while the rest of the waiters and waitresses were not .	1
659	My husband and I went on date night and had a blast! Our instructor was Melissa and she was friendly and full of energy. However, Melissa was a little fast and slightly vague in her instructions, but gave us plenty of time to paint each step. A finished painting was hanging that we could refer back too. Drinks are average price, $5 for beer and $7 for wine. Last call drinks are half price! We ate before going so I did not have a chance to try any of the food, but there is a 20 minute dinner break half way through for everyone to eat. There were a lot of people munching on appetizers throughout the painting class. This is something I will absolutely do again, and highly recommend it for anyone looking for something fun and different.	3
660	This place is okay. It's beautiful inside and our server was great! If you like hiphop and top hits type of music the Do not go on Saturday nights the music is horrible and was so bad that we didn't finish our hookah because the music started to sound like noise and just was not fun or entertaining also the DJ was some old guy that looked to be in his early 60's which was kinda whack. And apparently there is some sort of dress code. Me & my party was about 9 people and apparently only 2 of us were in dress code.  They had on a shirt and pants. They rest of us had shorts on and shirts and maxi dresses.... so I didn't really get that, but they let us in anyway and when we got in it was dead not too many people inside, my guess would be because of the horrible music. the place was kinda a joke.	2
661	Extremely disappointed and would not recommend consigning fairly new and nice furniture items.. I brought in 3 pieces of furniture that were purchased within a 2 year time period and were still in the store catalogs.  I gave them the receipts and they had priced them less than 1/2 of what they were purchased for and that was okay, but what disturbed me was, they were marked down within 2 weeks of being in the store and I was told that they had a lot of interest and it was priced to high.  The two desirable pieces sold as soon as they were marked down and the 3rd piece which was less desirable was never marked down ???.  I still can't figure that one out. When I questioned the man on the floor,  his response was we need to price that down too.  Very arrogant attitude and I learned my lesson the hard way.  There are many Consignment stores out there and they wait 60 days before they mark down an item and you split the purchase 50/50.  If it's a nice item, I'd go else where..	0
662	Don't stay here unless you really have to. There is no internet wifi in the rooms, they give you a short jack to put into the side of your computer... too bad I only had my ipad. Not to mention that the TV channels suck. I would't complain about that if they just had some stinking wifi! I mean why make me pay resort fees for such a shitty hotel? Last but not least, there was a bug in my room my last day I stayed and never been back since. Save some extra cash and go elsewhere.	0
663	I really like Pei Wei.  But you have to understand what it is.  It is a chain.  It is not quite fast food, but not quite a restaurant.  It is rarely great, but almost never bad.  It's consistent, like most chains are.\n\nThe crab wontons are tasty, and I love the sweet chili sauce that they come with.  \n\nMongolian Beef, Honey Seared Shrimp are a couple of our go-tos.\n\nThere are much better Chinese/Asian restaurants in the world.  There are also quite a few worse.  Like I said, it is consistent and reliable - and sometimes that's all I need.  I rarely crave Pei Wei specifically, but I would never turn it down.	2
664	We ended up here on a night when we were struggling to get in anywhere else so it was more in desperation than in expectation that we paid the \u00a37.50 to get in here.  Oh, how it wasn't value for money.\n\nOnce inside it was busy, the music was decent enough and well decorated throughout.  However, you can get all this elsewhere for far less expense and for \u00a37.50 I half expected it to be paved with gold (though I would have accepted something a bit special).\n\nI guess this place is just for people like me who didn't quite get in elsewhere arriving when every where else was busy and don't want to trek away from Georges Street.	1
665	A go to for a good dinner.  We have been there twice and both times were awesome.  The service was always prompt and courteous.  I have made recommendations to people I know, and have always been thanked after the fact by those who have eaten there.	4
666	Let's get fired up! *Claps* and *spirit sprinkles*... sorry the ex-cheerleader couldn't help but think of that chant when I walked in.  =P.  Okay, now we can talk about the joint.  The first thing that came to mind when I walked in was, this place has some character!  What a refreshing change from the overpopulation of chain restaurants on Ray road.  I was greeted immediately as I walked up to the front door, and the service continued to impress me throughout the entire meal.  I was waiting for my friends to arrive, so I decided to take advantage of the last few minutes of Happy hour and order a hummus tray and PAMI tini (Pomegranate martini). The Martini was very good, not as sweet as most places, which I prefer.  The pita bread on the hummus tray was fantastic, toasted just perfectly.  Of the trio we preferred the chipotle and pesto, the jalape\u00f1o cilantro was a little bland and surprisingly not spicy.   For dinner we all ended up ordering the same thing, so I can only report on one item.  It was their baked rotollo ... and it was fantastic!  It was like a huge manicotti stuffed with cheese, veggies and pesto, then topped with more cheese and red sauce.... an Italian vegetarians dream!  Fired up grill is a hidden gem in the middle of the chain mafia in Chandler. I'll definitely be back.	3
667	It's a very close distance to ny my hotel where we were staying. the prices are great. They have gluten free pancakes which is awesome. The food is really good compare to its price range. Nothing fancy but practically good.	3
668	A warehouse full of whiskey -sure, sounds like fun. A few of us dropped by Whiskey Warehouse after a late dinner down the street. \n\nWe arrived around 9:30 pm on a Friday night and, while it wasn't super crowded it was starting to fill up. The music was definitely loud and they were playing all sorts of tunes, mostly rap & pop when I was there. I agree with Julia S. - the crowd was pretty frat like - but frat brothers 10 years post-college. \n\nWe were able to order drinks right away and the bartender was fairly friendly and efficient. Just as their namesake states, they have an extensive whiskey menu, and I would hope the servers are helpful in those selections, but none of us partook in those libations. They also had a decent wine selection, too. Inside, WW sports a number of big flats screens and a partial brick/industrial feel inside. \n\nI imagine if you can score a table, this would be a good spot to hang with some friends for a few hours. They also offered some fairly sweet daily drink specials - one that caught my eye is their Sunday drink special - $2 mimosas and $3 Bloody Marys. Mmmmm hmmm...can't wait until noon on Sunday!	2
669	just wanted to chime in & say that this place is so vegetarian-UN-friendly it's not even funny. I was dragged here with family & ended up ordering a chile relleno, which was just about the only meatless item on the menu, short of a fucking cheese crisp.\n\nit wasn't terrible, but this place is really just all kinds of lame. service was mediocre, food was mediocre. with as many awesome & authentic mexican restaurants as there are in the valley, there's no reason on earth to come back, except MAYBE to try a mango margarita.	1
670	First time trying this place today. Placed a to-go lunch special order of spicy mint chicken. I feel jipped..! The order of spicy mint chicken was soooo small! I didn't get full whatsoever. An eggroll, wonton crisp, and steamed rice also came with the lunch special, but it still wasn't enough. The price wasn't bad.. $6.75. But I was soooo disappointed in the portion size. \n\nI won't be coming back here.	0
671	No, nope, uh uh, no way, please don't call this an Italian restaurant. Overcooked, mushy noodles, watery tomato gravy, and meatballs that are too garlicky and over spiced. Can't give this place anything lower than 1 star. Seriously, Olive Garden is a joke and I rate it higher than this place. \n\nAgain, my advice to any Italian food lover, find a good neighborhood, family owned restaurant and support a family and not a conglomerate.	0
672	Love the clothes,hate the staff! I'm sorry but something goes wrong every single time I come here. Today, brought 5 items to the counter, came home with 4. And that was from the kiddy mgr who had to take over because the rest had never seen a check before. After his 10 minutes of flubbing and absolutely ignoring anything I asked him he finally rang it up. Grrrr I hate having to go back.	1
673	"Though convenient to us, this PO is experiencing some problems; possibly due to inexperienced workers? After all, all one needs is to pass the civil service exam to work there.\nProblem 1: \""Anyone using a credit card?\"" I stepped out of the long line, glad there was another avenue to get my transaction done quickly. All I had to do was purchase a book of stamps and postage for a letter that needed delivery confirmation. The young man who helped me was apparently confused as to my request and by the time we were done, I could have stayed in line and been out sooner.\nProblem 2: We have one of those old fashion mailbox systems at our complex, where the mail person opens a row of mailboxes with a key, places the mail in their appropriate slots, then closes that row--or is supposed to. One day, the boxes were left open for almost an entire day, even after the local PO was called. Meantime, some things I was expecting in the mail have yet to arrive, or have they?"	1
674	"First to review, now the last.\nStopped by to see Hiro and Shige at \""Shiro Sushi\"" last night and there is a note on the door.\n\n\""Couldn't make it through the slow times\"".\n\nToo bad.\nHopefully we will find them elsewhere soon.\nTJ"	0
675	Great place to have a beer or have anything from their great menu. The bar and sitting area is as hip and rustic as it gets. Very friendly staff and all around a good place to be a usual hang-out place.	3
676	My sister and I headed over here last week and I have to say, I was a little mixed about our visit.\n\nWhen we first walked in, there was no one there. Literally. We were eye'ing the ice creams for almost 5 minutes before the server drifted in from the Z Pizza side.\n\nI had the Pink Spot sundae with two ginormous scoops of kona coffee and hot fudge. The ice cream was meh, but the hot fudge was very good and served in generous portion. My sister had the low-fat coffee with ribbons of chocolate and she raved.\n\nThe prices weren't outrageous considering the serving size; just one week before I spent three dollars more for the same exact thing at Mary Coyle's.\n\nI wasn't overly impressed with the ice cream, but they get props for always having at least one low fat, sugar free, or sorbet offering.\n\nIt probably wouldn't be my first choice for ice cream, but because they are in the neighborhood they get a gold star for convenience!	2

678	Okay - so let's start this off right... We went to see Ziggy Marley concert there last night & the music/entertainment was amazing!!\n\nOkay - on to the rest... 1st of all the parking for this event was ridiculous! Only saw one staffer that finally closed a gate & was there to tell people to move on past a full parking lot, but all other areas were a ghost town with no direction, no communication on where else to park. We were all driving around like crazy people. You would think with the amount of money made from ticket sales, they would be able to afford to put a little more into an event like this. Guess not!?! \n\nLet's head inside... only accepts cash at the outside bar - again ridiculous! Then when we moseyed on over to the inside bar (Radio Bar) - what horrible service, actually that's not all true because we never got service! We were patient, held out hand graciously, we tried just to say what we wanted in hopes that one of only 3 bartenders would pay attention, but there was blatant ignoring going on & we were in the front, on the bar... Needless to say - we decided that we would get faster service at our Home Bar inside our kitchen 35 minutes away - so we left & it was a great decision to finish with a nightcap on our couch talking about the evenings awesome Ziggy Marley Entertainment!\n\nFort McDowell Casino you have some work to do!!	1
679	"It really depends on what you want out of the show.\n\nGet your ass rocked off? No. \nWhy would you come to this type of show?\n\nTo simply be entertained? Get a sense of variety in a show?\nTHAT you will get. And how.\nIt is what I guess would be described as \""a Vegas Show\"".\nThe musicians were Top Shelf. Props to the band!\n\nThe Audience / Crowd? \n\""Are there any Rednecks here tonight?\"" and the place went nuts..........\nYou get the picture.\n\nTalented dude no doubt.\n$100 a ticket. YOW!!\nGlad there are ways around that as a \""local\"".\nAnd at 1-1/2 hours the show was REALLY getting close to too long.\n\nokay been there done that...whats next?"	2
680	Busy Busy Busy!  Seems like everytime I go there is a line out the door.  Our entrees were good as usual, and I don't mind the wait.\n\nIf  you don't like to wait in line to order your food, you might want to consider calling ahead to order and pick up your food.\n\nThe location is usually very clean, loud either from the music or people talking, but there's also an outdoor area you can eat at.\n\nThey have very good guacamole for a fast food place, and the tortilla chips have a lime-salt flavor that accompanies the guacamole really well.	2
681	One of the better Pho spots in Phoenix, Angelina's combines a high class appeal with great Pho and service.\n\nI was very pleased at the Rare Steak Pho. The meat was very high quality and they brought lots of extras, including fresh cilantro and Italian Parsley. The size was enough to be filling, even at a medium. Noodles were tasty and the broth was pleasant.\n\nThe sunflower shrimp appetizer was amazing. Very good way to start the dinner. The green tea was full of spices and had a unique taste that made it very good to drink.\n\nThe ambiance was very classy. My waiter was professional, courteous, and respectful. She came to our table just often enough to be perfect.\n\nDefinitely will be coming here again.	4
682	"Summary: lol wtf is this sh*t?\n\nFull Re-of the-View:\nFirst off nobody noticed us waiting to get seated for what felt like forever, the place wasn't super busy either so no excuse there, unless they want people to walk out...hey maybe they wanted to save us the torment of eating there? We should have taken the hint, but we didn't. \nBummer.\n\nSeated, a miracle!\nOne drink got ordered by the hubster, I hadn't decided yet *shrug* figured when the waitress comes and gives him his drink I will know what I want and be able to order it.\nNope.\nShe runs past our table smacks his drink down without saying a word and storms off again. \n\nEventually I get to order my drink and some food too (gasp!), I went for the roast beef sandwich and the well-hydrated dude across the table went for the quesadilla. \nBLAARRGGHH! \nDo these people not know what seasoning is? Or hell salt even?\nBland, hard, yuck. \nIf you make mushrooms and beef bland you have failed at life, simple as that.\nThe quesadilla looked worse than your average Taco Bell disaster but at least it had some sort of flavour..nothing good, but hey you can't ask for miracles in this place (like edible food and decent service).\nOur waitress had gotten lost at this point and we wanted to leave, so we had to poke the barman in order to pay for our \""food\"" (ha! food..).\n\nOh! I forgot to mention that my fries contained one really old \""bottom of the fry basket for the last 10+ batches\"" black fry, yay! I left it triumphantly sticking out of the mayo for them, as the fry equivalent of a middle-finger, it was the least I could do. \n\nWhy do people go here???"	0
683	The management doesn't know how to handle large crowds. They need a better work flow system. Waited 1.5 hours, got chocolate cannoli and regular cannoli. I gave the regular cannoli to a homeless person only because I didn't want to waste food. Truly disappointed! Not worth the wait, time, or money!	0
684	I am not a huge fan of buffets but I thought coming to this buffet would change it. Not was I wrong! Still not a fan of buffets! Everything was so soggy or really tough.\n\nMy husband somewhat likes buffets and this one did not impress him either....\n\nI recommend coming with a Local resident because they get a 50% off discount! Definitely the only plus side.\n\nOne complaint I have is that their exit area needs to be more cut off or secure because we saw people walking in through the exit to get gelato or to plop down at tables with no receipt and basically eat for free! We saw at least five people walk in without being detected.	1
685	"I really, really wanted to like this restaurant. Hip, quirky, vegetarian/vegan. Lots of owls and kitschy deco. I eat meat occasionally, but had a vegetarian buddy here to visit, and thought this would be a great choice. What's not to love, right? \n\nWell, for starters, the service. Our server was really nice, and had lots of reviews, suggestions and alternate ideas for what we should order... but the service was mind-numbingly, ridiculously slow-- and the place was half empty. Plus, even after two requests for napkins (which were not provided to begin with, and not available from other empty tables around us) we never received any napkins at all. I'm not really a messy eater, but come on!\n\nMaybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the \""firesticks\"" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake.\n\nWe had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably a ridiculous wait) per milkshake, we decided to hit The Milkshake Factory on East Carson instead."	1
686	Excellent service, free samples, versatile menu,. I love this place.\n\nThey offer brunch, and lunch special crepes as well as tons of dessert options. I actually came in for lunch, not dessert with my bf and ordered the special crepe called Rosbif with roast beef, cheese, and mushrooms. Yum! Very delicious. It came with a salad and I wished I asked the waitress what the salad dressing was because it was so good. My bf ordered a waffle with semisweet chocolate sauce, and a salted crepe. His waffle was not too soft, not too hard....just the right texture. The semisweet chocolate tasted great, it melted in your mouth. That's when you know it's good quality chocolate.\n\nWaitress was very attentive and I enjoyed the free American style hot chocolate sample. I will definitely come back again and try more of the desserts and drinks. (I noticed there was a chocolate soda!!)	3
687	Ughhh. I gave alchemy a second.. third.. Chance.  They finally had enough sense to drop their absurd prices ($15 for a pretty average burger? Come on...) so I thought they were worthy of another shot.  Welp, they replaced their absurd prices with absurd service and a lack of pretty much every item on the menu.  I mean, at 10 PM on a Friday night, how can you possibly be out of almost all of your draft beers, Captain Morgan, and half of your appetizers, INCLUDING the one that the waiter recommended?   Maybe you should make sure you actually have something before recommending that your customers order it?  And OH WAIT... they didn't ACTUALLY drop the prices.. they just stopped included fries with your meal and charge 4 freaking dollars to add them on.  So let's do the math... 5 lbs of potatoes costs about $3 - you get about 4 oz. of fries -  so the true cost is somewhere around 15 cents?  Sounds like a rip-off to me.   \n\nSad.. this place could be cool.  But alas, it sucks.  Spend your money elsewhere.  And hope that the schmuck running this place takes a look at some of these reviews and gets a clue.	0
688	Pierogi pizza is amazing!!!! They ran out of traditional pierogis which was a total bummer but then we saw the pizza. It was more satisfying than pierogis on a cold rainy night. The red leaf side salad was tasty but over dressed and didn't come with the blue cheese the menu promised. The special pierogis of the night were not amazing because the butter added in unwelcome sweet flavor to the jalape\u00f1o, cheddar bacon yumminess. The beer was great and the interior of the place is fun. A large brewing system sits on the alter and is  quite beautiful. The reason the place did not get 5 stars is because honestly out service sucked and the fact that they use styrofoam to go containers. The waiter did not greet us, tell us specials or attend to us. At one point when we were finished (napkins on plates) for a few minutes waiting for the check he was in the corner watching the game.	2
689	I was trapped across the street at the God awful RnR bar. I was longing to be there instead. It looked like a fun friendly place from across the road and the few bikers that crossed the road to check out RnR were good guys. I just feel odd without  a bike going there.	2
690	I'm not impressed. The donuts tasted old and was not very sweet. There were not many donuts to choose from. I ordered a snickerdoodle latte that tasted more like coffee than the sugary diabetes I was anticipating. The person working the register was a bit rude as well. He acted like I was taking up his time. I always wondered why there weren't many Dunkin Donuts in California. If this is a reflection of how the stores are run, there's no need to put up more stores.	0

692	"Pizza Cat admits she likes this chain. \n\nYes, you can even find CPK in the FREEZER SECTION AT WALMART, but that's because it's good and Pizza Cat cannot turn down good food. \n\nPizza Cat had grown up on CPK as a kitten, so as newer, faster, leaner pizza places cropped up, CPK was thrown to the side. Full-disclosure: Pizza Cat admits a lot of the food she will review, she has tasted over the last decade. But she recently had their new California Flatbreads, which were delicious. \n\nPizza Cat got their Spicy Fennel Sausage with Poblano Chiles Flatbread and their Bianco Flatbread (truffle cream, gorgonzola, mozza and fresh sage). Both were delicious. The Poblano chiles they used did not taste like chile rellenos. Instead, they were thin, strips, almost shavings of the chile. It had a bite, the combination of the cheese, oregano and chile was extraordinary. As was the combination of gorgonzola and fresh sage. Who said CPK had lost their touch? They may have become corporate, but they still have their creative flair. \n\nPizza Cat was glad to see they kept many of their long-time favorites on the menu. She recommends their Sedona Tortilla soup and Dakota Smashed pea soup. Unbelievably good. \n\nPizza Cat says their original BBQ chicken pizza is good  and so is their Thai Chicken Pizza and/or Thai Crunch salad. Her favorite is the Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza that comes with chilled field greens on top. \n\nUnfortunately, their \""ordinary\"" pizzas are not as good. *shrugs*\n\nService was less than stellar, it was on par to what she'd find at Chipotle. \n\nBut food is still tasty and prices are reasonable and it's located in a convenient location. \n\nCan't say no to that!"	3
693	This is literally the first place I went when I first came to Pittsburgh - and I loved it. Hearty, full-sized meals, lots to choose from, and not too crowded or noisy. Although, for the sake of full disclosure, I didn't sit at the bar and I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment on that. I go back to Pittsburgh often and Rock Bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night. Really, I have no complaints about this place so I'm surprised by the few low ratings here.	3
694	"\""It's a manufacturer problem, not a dealership problem.\""  That's what I was told by\nGeneral Sales Manager, Ken Welsh during a phone conversation after posting my one star rating of the dealership on YELP earlier this month.  Mr. Welsh told me that there is really nothing he can do about the defective and poorly performing 2013 SRX which I bought from Arrowhead Cadillac in May, adding that my wife and I should just \""enjoy the car.\""   Quite condescending, wouldn't you say?  Would you want to buy an automobile plagued with problems from a dealership, only to be told that  that \""It is a manufacturer problem, not a dealership problem?   I think not.  THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING A VEHICLE FROM ARROWHEAD CADILLAC.   2 THUMBS DOWN."	0
695	"IMHO, Bacchanal may have the best buffet, but Wicked Spoon has the best desserts.\n\nI'm not usually a dessert guy, but there was one dish from here that literally made me cry. True story. More on that later...\n\nWicked Spoon offers a smorgasbord of small plates that are decadently rich in flavor, calories, cholesterol and so on. Most of everything is plated beautifully so it's very pleasing on the eyes as well as your stomach. If it's not plated, it's in a small container that makes it easy to carry as well as to eat. It's definitely not a buffet that leaves a huge mess. \n\nThey have all kinds of protein from pork belly, kalbi-style ribs, lamb, prime rib etc... What also stands out from other buffets is that they serve bone marrows. Yes, that rich, fatty, oily, creamy part inside the bone that will ensure your arteries will clog, your blood pressure will rise and makes your brain say \""Uncle\"" on the richness and fattiness on every single bite similar to Foie Gras. It's definitely not a food that one should eat everyday, but in moderation. Oh, but sprinkle some kosher salt and spread it on a cracker and it's irresistible. \n\nThey have seafood, salad, pasta, pizza, Chinese, Mexican, Italian and so on. Another plate that me and the Wifey kept going back for was the savory watermelon on a bed of Balsamic Vinegar topped with cream cheese was oh so good. It's a one-bite plate and everything comes together with a perfect balance and flavor note. It's also light so I didn't feel so guilty stuffing my mouth like a garbage compactor. Well...I probably had 8 plates of that thing. \n\nI didn't try everything as I made sure to save room for desserts. The gelatos were on point and the Coffee-flavored gelato had nibbles of wafers in them giving it an added texture and flavor, which was a nice surprise. I also had the Thai Tea-flavored gelato and Wifey had the Pistachio. \n\nAnd for me, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was the White Chocolate Mousse Cake with Exotic Cream. Like I mentioned, I'm not usually a dessert guy and I shouldn't be eating desserts for personal reasons, but this one dessert was on another level. From just looking at it, it looks like a simple dessert cake with a gold leaf topping. But one bite took me to a happy place way back during my childhood that instantly made me think of my mom. I was crying with joy and happiness and even tried to prevent a tear from falling on the corner of my eye to no avail. \n\nEvery other bite could not stop the tear from falling onto my cheeks as I thought of my mom. This dessert literally reminded me of my mom. The sweetness was just right as it was not overly sweet. The shell of the exterior, the filling and the pie crust combined together with the tanginess of the sauce made a perfect blend that created a harmonious music in my mouth. All the components together was so perfectly balanced and easily ranked as one of the best desserts I've ever tasted. \n\nJust thinking about it is making me tear up again. \n\n*sigh*\n\nFor a dessert dish that makes me think of my mom is surely a special dish in my book. It's WICKED!"	3
696	Went here back in may 2011... Pretty damn good donuts, reminds me of a donut shop that used to be open in my old stomping grounds. selection was limited at the time i went here but the 4 kinds i had were awesome. will return when im like 40 ... if ever	2
697	"Tubing down the Salt River was an experience comparable to floating down the River Styx (from Greek Stux, also meaning \""hate\"" and \""detestation\""). I feel like I not only circled the underworld nine times but got sucked into it, and the ferryman Charon was a beer-bong wielding asshole.\n\nMy best girlfriend & I got there when it opened at 9 and the first part of our tubing experience was very pleasant, but now I know it's only because at that point it was still too early for everyone else to have gotten sufficiently plastered. We had our cooler tied between our two tubes and yes, we had a few beers too, but we were just looking to have a nice chill float down the river. We met some cool people along the way, hung out for a bit before we'd drift on down our way. A couple hours into it we stopped off at the side of the river, and a group of twentysomethings, mostly guys and a few girls, had banked as well, and asked if we wanted jello shots. So we figured yeah, cool, & hung out and drank with them for a bit. But it turns out they're the type of people who feel like if they give you a bit of alcohol, you owe them your freakin' life. At this point what I figure happened is, these guys were looking to get laid, & when me and my girl went to bail, they flipped out. I was supposed to catch a late afternoon flight back to San Diego, and she was supposed to go to work after dropping me off at the airport, and these assholes f*cked everything up. They dumped our little tube with a tub on it which held all of our stuff- cooler, shorts, sandals, towels, sunblock, water, everything. And somehow sent our other tubes cascading down the river; my girl managed to somehow retrieve her car key by some miracle at least. By then I had gotten out of the water, she swam back and joined me, and one of the guys got in her face talking sh*t and looking like he was about to hit her, which pissed both of us off so we started going off on them. Then they called some sort of gang code that somebody else recognized, to which they informed me and my girl we were f*cking with the Hells Angels and we best step back. At this point one of the guys' girls still floating in the river starts yelling at me, to which I simply yell \""SHUT UP,\"" and she did. Smart move, because I was livid. \n\nAnyway they didn't seem like any Hells Angels to me, just some wannabe thugs who'd been drinking all day, but they were Hell's something because they sure ruined our day on the River Styx. So now me and her go to one of the firemen guys standing around at the side of the river, and ask if they can help, and they say they can't do anything unless we're drowning. Oh great, we can nearly get beat down by these punks but unless we're drowning, we're SOL? They gave me this bullshit little compass thing, but I didn't need help finding my direction, I needed help finding my hope in the general decency of humanity, which had been swept down the river along with all of my belongings. No compass was going to help me find that.\n\nAwhile later we encounter this group of hippies on a big raft, who graciously scoop us up and ferry us to our pickup point down the river, and these people were so kind and amazing compared to the drunks surrounding us, plus the guy steering the thing looks like he could be Jesus. They helped redeem a bit of my faith in the world, especially when one of them gave me their oversized flip flops as mine had been lost and my feet were already badly cut up.\n\nSo in retrospect, was it an unforgettable experience? Definitely. Would I want to repeat it again? Definitely not. \n\nNow I know what spring break in Hell is like."	1
698	Six years ago Filibertos were springing up everywhere. They were monopolizing the fast food mexican trade and putting all the polibertos, rolibertos, and Humberto's out of business, or at least that was the game plan. Today I am back in AZ and am saddened to see how much of a big player filibertos has become. With their streamlined business model, professionally designed identity and logo, and their official website, they have turned a personal relationship between taqueria and taco eaters into a perverted faceless business venture. Give me back my taco truck on the side of the road, not this futuristic look into the big taco machine. All conspiracy aside, the experience true taco lovers were accustomed to is all but dead, the flavors have become bland and the exchange is no different than driving Through a jack in the box or del taco. Socorro and Conchita are no longer hanging out the drive through window yelling at you in Spanish, the cook isn't also the owners cousin and landscaper on the weekends. But worst of all the Horchata is watered down. There are a few things I can look the other way for, but watered down Horchata is just not one of them. People, just because a restaurant looks new and clean and their drive through speakers work doesn't mean they are up to par. What are you willing to sacrifice for a uniform big box feel and convenience? You aren't getting lower prices, you are only getting lowered standards when it comes to taste. I don't need my drive through lady to speak perfect English and I don't need for the cook to wear a shirt when he's frying the meat, what I do need is true authentic flavor, nothing can ever come before that.	0
699	It's really hard to beat the food quality, service, and value you get at Oregano's. Susan and I patronized the Flagstaff location weekly for years and now we are fortunate enough to live in Gilbert and have the Gilbert restaurant to visit. A little wait sometimes is part of the experience that makes it worth while... you wouldn't be waiting if it wasn't good. The salads are probably our favorites. Always enough for two people to share. Try the Italian Wedding Soup... supurb!\nGood job Oregano's!	4
700	"The specialized, high quality, service they provide at Brunsell is a valued addition to this community. That being said, however, their service is atrocious and their business could improve measurably with a few very simple improvements. \n\nFor instance, why not have a price list available for things like Knit bowls and knobs? Instead, they require you to go and ask the surly, rude, \""why are you bothering me\"" sales people at the customer service desk. At the very least, they should rename the desk.\n\nAs the owner of an old home in an historic neighborhood, I will continue to come back here, but I know they could probably make my life a lot easier Anselmi many more products than they are, if they took the time to bother to find out my needs. I will continue to buy salvage antique trims or stock from Home Depot and Menard's, just to avoid having to talk to these people again."	1
701	I've had good times at Ri-Ra, and I've had some bad times.\nMost of the good times were due to the band playing, which is sometimes really good, and most of the bad times were a combination of bad music and overcrowding.\n\nThis place has been a popular mainstay of downtown/uptown as long as I can remember. \nIt's tall and long inside but very narrow, and when its crowded it can offer up a bit of a claustrophobic vibe.\n\nSince its so popular, it can draw a bit of an unruly, late-night crowd as well. Most of the people here are cool however, and the staff seem to be nice and accommodating. \n\nStill, its hard to get a beer or drink, and I usually don't spend more than an hour or two here before bailing for more comfortable confines.\n\nI can't speak to the food, as I've never eaten here. I have seen a menu though, and it looks decent, and decently priced.	2
702	I was definitely not impressed with this restaurant. There wasn't enough variety and my street noodle dish was subpar at best. It lacked any wow factor. The only dish I would recommend is the steamed pork bun. Literally the only thing I will go in there for. Otherwise, I would not suggest going here. It is overhyped.	1
703	First off, the food was very good and deserves four stars. The problem was the service. The server was constantly forgetting to bring us things we had asked so we had to ask the bussers as they passed by. We understood at first since he was taking care of a large party but after they left, he only had us and still was absent!  Having been a restaurant corporate trainer for servers and managed restaurants I tend to be a little more patient than most but this went beyond my patience. I will definitely give them another try since the food was good but hopefully they redeem themselves with their service.	2
704	Great Mexican restaurant inside Planet Hollywood. Affordable,  a lot of food to share, good guacamole and salsa chips, friendly and fast service.  Nice seating area inside and outside, expectantly view. Over all - super satisfied!!!	4
705	"This is only for breakfast, since that's the only one I've had.\n\nHaving tried several breakfast buffets on the Strip, I have to say this isn't anything spectacular. The $16.99 price is kind of in-between, not too outrageous but from that I did expect more than what you get. \n\nThey have the basics covered - eggs, sausage, bacon, ham, potatoes, french toast, pancakes, omelette station, fruit, yogurt, cereal, bagels, etc. Then a salad area, a few cold seafood salads, and a seemingly random area with I guess  \""Asian\"" options, like miso soup and noodles and that type of thing. A few extra points for the biscuits and gravy, the gravy was quite good. Oh, and the breakfast burrito mix with tortillas was a nice option.\n\nIt seems like a large enough area but its the same stuff at all the stations, so what seemed like a large selection really isn't. The food was all good, but nothing special and I've paid less for better on the Strip. The service was on the lower end as well - I realize they aren't going to be tipped much and I'm sure they know that, but when their only job is to take your drink order I get really annoyed when the waitstaff doesn't even bother to check and see if you need your drinks refilled, as was the case here. Won't be coming back."	1
706	The food is worth 4 stars but I took a star away because their hours suk.  They're closed Tues - Fri from 2:30-5pm. They're also closed on Sunday & Monday. Their food does taste authentic but it's on the more expensive side.  Their margaritas are pretty weak - they're poured from this pitcher that's refrigerated so they're not freshly made.	2
707	The poorest service I have experienced in Montreal .	0
708	I've had every carrier you can think of (except, of course, Cricket).  The customer service at T-Mobile is awesome!  I *had* to have the RAZR two years ago.  Ugh.  It was the worst phone ever.  Wasn't T-Mobile's fault, just Motorola.  Anyway, visited the store twice and had to get replacement phones.  Each time, they exchanged the phone for free.\nEven now when I have troubles, I go in and everyone is friendly and helpful.  \nI'm still with them for another couple years (I keep needing new phones!) and wouldn't change providers for anything right now.	4
709	They keep deleting my negative review that the SharpStone grinders they have are knockoffs and they only acknowledge this if you inquire directly if they are knockoffs.  They sell them as if they are true SharpStone grinders.	0
710	I went to this location yesterday and I was very disappointed. The lady at the drive thru was very rude.	2
711	Has got to be the worse mcdonalds I have ever been too. I thought all the other reviews were just being mean, but they're right. I walked in at 1:20pm on a Thursday. There was one family waiting for ice cream cones but other than that, no one else was in line or near the counter. I watched as the cashier got the ice cream cones made and handed to the kids and even when she looked at me and I smiled at her, she still did not return the smile or greet me. There was another worker bagging drive thru food and another employee sweeping the floor. All of them looked directly at me. Not one of them greeted. \nI waited for 10 minutes WITH NO ONE ELSE IN LINE before I finally was asked what I wanted. They were all talking to each other and joking around with the cooks about nonsense. \nI finally got my drink, the soda was flat, and when I got my food, the buns were stale and the fried were old and cold. \nThe seats were falling apart. The booth I sat in moved every time the teen on the other side of it moved. They then made it a game and continued to move it and laugh about it with their friends. One woman sat in another booth next to mine and the seat nearly collapsed to the ground because of how unstable it was. \nI was just looking for cheap dollar menu before work but this wasn't even worth the dollar.	0
712	"So wait staff was okay, but management was possibly the worst.  After requesting our table to have one more seat added they refused based on \""security reasons\"". When asked to expand on this concept the manager replied with a blank stare as if we were in the know of a secret plot to over run the place.... in reality we wanted some cigars and a cocktail,  that's it. But at the of the day the cocktails were watered down and not good. The cigars were great but... come on."	0
713	Delicious huge slices for affordable prices, the combo is a great deal. Very friendly service too.	4
714	I went to this cleaners for alteration to a gown. They told me they would alter the hem of the gown for $10-15, which I thought was a great deal because I had just been quoted $30. I left the dress and was told it would be ready by Thursday (I needed it for an event that day). I was called on Wednesday saying the cost was actually about $50, and would not be ready until Friday. I asked for the dress back but the dress was at a different location and they could not have it back to me. My plan was to take it to another location to get hemmed. Given the short amount of time, I ended up having them alter the gown although it was expensive. I ended up wearing a different gown since, although it was ready by Thursday, it was too late and I couldn't pick it up. The manager only gave me a 10%-15%. As good business practice, she should have given me the original price I was quoted.  At the end of it all, I ended up paying more (about $48), and the hem on the gown was done sloppily and the material now has a permanent wave at the base of the dress (probably because if the thread and tension used). It is an expensive and fancy gown, so I was pretty bummed they did a sloppy job. The positive: the two ladies I worked with were nice and professional.	1
715	Just when I thought I couldn't love NY Flavor any more than I already do, Bill and Lynn along with Chef Craig top themselves again. Now they are offering a 10% discount to anyone who shows their PTA Membership card. So not only do they make delicious foods at decent prices and are the friendliest, cleanest restaurant in Surprise, they are embracing the community to help out our schools, parents, and kids by joining the ranks of the largest child advocacy organization in the country! What's not to love about this place???	4
716	EM Cafe opened two years ago and was a hit from the start, mainly because the decor is breezy and effortless. It's got tall ceilings, white walls showcasing local artists, and a big table in the middle for communal eating or large groups. The food itself is pretty basic, although recently there's been a dip in quality of some of the food (potatoes are getting complaints). Sandwiches, omelettes, and french toast are all pretty good and portions are decent (not huge, but decent).\n\nIt's become something of a fixed hangout in the Mile End, which is saying a lot because Parc Avenue has this reputation of killing every establishment that tries to thrive within the first 6 months.	3
717	We recently moved to Mesa,Arizona, and the home we bought needed flooring in one of the bedrooms.  We needed the flooring in ASAP, not knowing anyone who does this kind of work we turned to yelp, and read the reviews on Red Mountain Renovations.  It turned out that RMR lived up to their billing.  I contacted Scott, and after he heard what our situation was, he told us that he would be able to accommodate our needs.  The very next day Adam showed up and laid the flooring in a very professional manner.  We will be contacting Red Mountain Renovations for all our flooring needs.  Thank you Scott and Adam.	4
718	Quite possibly the worst chipotle location ever. The staff is lazy and slow. They consistently have you repeat your order because they can't remember 3 ingredients. They argue with each other and you can tell they don't work well together. The wait is outrageous pretty much any time of day! I've been here 3 times in 2 weeks and I have not waited less than 20 minutes. Even today the line was only 5 people long and it took 20 minutes because they kept running out of stuff. \n\nI absolutely love chipotle and the food here is no exception in that regard. my bowl was delicious as always but there are dozens of chipotles in the area here so why bother with this awful location? \n\nThey probably don't even read these reviews because they don't care about their guests.\n\nThe cash girl was busy flirting with an employee not working. The black guy on grill was busy watching everyone coming through the door instead of preparing for the rush. (they ran out of rice, hot sauce, beans, and chicken while I was here. 15 minute wait for chicken!) \n\nLook for another chipotle to eat at! It's great food but 0 star service here.	0
719	I'm not the best person to ask an opinion about when it comes to McDonalds. In fact I hate it. I quit eating it about ten years ago, that is until someone decided that after they took my order for Burger King and they weren't open that they would run here to get food. LAME.\n\nI wasn't going to be fussy and have a tantrum like a little kid, so I caved and let them bring me food from here. I can guarantee that I ate it like a two year old kid. I picked at it, played with it, complained about it, and if I could have, I would have fed it to a dog. However, I view that as animal cruelty.\n\nI give them kudos for attempting to be festive and mix the grease with leafy greens, but it still comes down to that nasty grease they fry everything in.  That's all my tongue sensed. I hated the food and then myself later that night as I made many trips to the bathroom, cursing each time. \n\nRemember, beggars can't be chooser. So when it comes to McDonalds, panhandle elsewhere.	1
720	Great location right off the lake with indoor/outdoor seating, family friendly (Weds are family night), great Mexican food (yes, its greasy)-with about 10 dinner combos which can please just about anyone, AND we get a buy one get one free through the mail almost weekly that it just makes sense to keep coming back for more! =) Plus their chips, salsa, and bean dip just about seal the deal for me! Yummy!	3
721	Decent food here but come on, is it really the food you come here for? I like coming here when I have my irish cravings and need a good ol glass of guiness.	2
722	The service could be better.  Much better.  We waited about 10 minutes before we were asked for our drink, which was at the same time we ordered our food.  The food was good.  Not excellent, but definitely good.  I don't think I would go back again just for the mere reason that there are other places to try.  I wasn't extremely impressed.	1
723	"Whenever I talk about Madison to someone out of town, they always say \""I hear there is a great Farmer's Market\""\n\nRight they are.  There are few like it.\n\nTake the entire Capital square, and line it with local vendors.  It's quite the experience.\n\nHere's what to expect:  Fresh produce, meats, breads, cheeses, flowers, and more all produced within a short drive of Madison.  You'll also get samples of many of those items.  \n\nYou are going to pay a lot more for stuff than what you'd pay the grocery store, but the point here is not to save money.  It's to contribute to sustainable farm-to-fork production.  You're typically getting organic, free range, well-cared for food.   You'll find many items far tastier than what you'd find at the store as well.\n\nPro tip:  Get there before 9AM or else you'll face massive crowds.  Also, leave the dogs at home, as they are not allowed."	4
724	I've been here a number of times for both brunch and dinner, and I think this is a pretty solid three-star restaurant - it's not bad but nothing amazing, and consistently so. \n\nThe service has always been decent, and the food has never been bad... just never exceptional. The seasonal menu does keep things a bit new and different, but I'd also say the prices are a bit on the high end for the caliber of restaurant in this area. However, that hasn't always been the case - before there were loads of other great options in the cultural district, this place used to be my pre-theater go-to for dinner or drinks. Now, with more than a half-dozen competing restaurants within walking distance, Six Penn just doesn't stand out so much.\n\nI think one of the biggest draws of this establishment for me now would be the rooftop dining, which provides a really nice atmosphere, provided you can get seated up there. It's one of the last unique features of this establishment that I'd be willing to pay a premium for, but with this becoming more popular in the cultural district as well, I'm not sure it will be so exclusive for long.\n\nOverall, if you're thinking about going here, I'd say go - especially if one of the seasonal dishes catches your eye. Would also definitely recommend requesting a roof table if the weather is nice and they've available.	2
725	Where do I start? \nThe mixologist of course! Daniel was runnin the juice joint while June was out of town. Wow! The drinks that he made (his own), were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Especially this one..... well, I can't tell you,  it's a secret. From beginning to end he was darb! No where else can you go and have a personal mixologist, in a private setting, and in Las Vegas, or anywhere! \nI can't really begin to decribe every single detail in this place. The thought that went into it is incredible.  Everywhere you look you see something else to appreciate. I don't want to spoil anything. So all I can say is trust the reviews! \nI also have to give a shout out to the talented piano player that played for us, Spidoni (I hope I got that right). He is there on Wed night only. Great guy and plays beautifully. \nOne last thing. I would definitely recommend going early. There are very few seats anyway, but my husband and I sure enjoyed having Dan, just about all to ourselves!\nTruly the BEST experience and can't wait to return!	4
726	Before I even entered they wanted to charge me and my partner $40.00 as an entrance fee. Go to share or piranha night club they do not charge locals an entrance fee.	0
727	This place is a disaster!  The prices do not reflect the poor quality of the food.  I ordered the rib eye steak and it was ultra thin, gritty, and overcooked and it was topped with a sauce that did not complement the rest of the meal.  The steak was no better than what you would receive at Denny's at 2 AM in the morning.  This place is way over priced and the food flat out sucks.  Todd English needs to re-evaluate the direction of Olives.  I felt this way the first time around and I didn't say anything, but after my second visit to the restaurant I couldn't let my disappointment in the cuisine slide.  The public needs to know that this restaurant is a rip off.   If you want good food go to BOAS or the Stratosphere.	0
728	Best pizza I've had since living in the greater Phoenix area, hands down! Pizzeria Bianco is located in a quaint historic area of downtown Phoenix surrounded by several other turn of the century homes that have since been turned into little restaurants and bars. We went here after hearing some good reviews for lunch this past Saturday. We got here around 3ish so we were able to get a table right away on their front patio in the shade, but things fill up pretty quickly and I've heard its fairly typical to wait an hour for a table. We split a salad and had the margarita pizza with added fennel sausage. Everything is very simple but is done with very high quality ingredients that gives the food a very unique and delicious flavor! We will for sure be back!	4
729	I didn't wanna write a review but since 2 days late ,still feeling bad from the clam pizza....I'd have to say this place is no good.	0
730	We came here after partying at Laboom, lateish Saturday night.\n\nChez Paree is a nice club. It's probably the cleanest, best kept strip club I've ever been in. Lots of seating; nice, warm atmosphere; good music at a nice volume; well dressed bouncers and wait-staff and a good dj.  \n\nThere are lots of girls, they're all attractive (and natural - I don't think I saw a single pair of fake breasts in the place), and there's no breaks between stage shows. However, I'm sorry to say that most of the stage shows were pretty boring, and the girls on stage looked somewhat apathetic while up there. \n\nThere was a bachelor party in the club, and a couple of girls put on a pretty entertaining show, abusing the groom-to-be on stage - standard bachelor party fare you'll see in any club (east of Manitoba anyway), but entertaining none the less. \n\nNone of the stage shows inspired me to drop cash on a private dance though. \n\nCover is cheap ($5), there's a mandatory coat check ($2.25). you need to tip the bouncer to get seated ($5) and drinks are pricey ($9.75?). Table dances are $10 per song or $150 per hour, contact dances are $15 per song or $220 per hour. There's an ATM but just arrive with a good amount of cash in hand. \n\nThe ladies room wasn't all that impressive - not filthy but not as clean as the rest of the club. The men's room is open, the ladies' room is locked (probably to keep drunk guys from wandering in) - if you need to use it, get the key at the entrance of the club first. \n\nIf the dancers had been a little more enthusiastic on stage this would have been a thoroughly excellent club. As it was, I was bored and didn't stay very long.	2
731	We arrived a little after 3pm with a group of 20, including 16 with Special Needs.  No line, plenty of empty tables and we gave our Groupons and had to pay $2.49 per person extra ( tax?).  They wanted us to pay $100 for gratuity to sit together in the same EMPTY area; another union rule.   More later on that.  I said no problem, we aren't moving since we were already seated, but told them they just lost any additional tip we were planning on leaving above the $100.  This is union policy, I was told again.  Well, keep your union policies.   Those are the workers the union protects..  Good for the union.  The service was awful, the food was just as bad and I would never recommend this place to anybody who has any food taste/class.   As soon as we finished, I had two vomit ( un- sweetened tea must have been off temperature).   None of us ate more than a bit of anything.  Most items weren't labeled so the one with a seafood allergy, ended up with seafood in the pasta.   Not labeled.   Chicken Noodle Soup isn't a selection of soup.  It was the only choice.   Desserts were just awful.   The best was the Ice Cream and it can from a machine.   Don't go,  not recommended; rather stay hungry than eat this rubbish.  Service was terrible, but then again, unions only hire the best workers...wrong...least motivated.... yes!   Fool me once...Never again.	0
732	Staff was dressed in 20's gear, cute touch. Still very pricey drinks, but a very cool and mellow atmosphere. Good place to sit and talk - Saturday night they had a DJ spinning live.	1
733	Sapporo is my favorite place to eat in all of Arizona. I love the teppanyaki grill.  We go for Happy Hour quite a bit and the staff is always so nice and the food is AMAZING! I have suggested it to family and friends and they all rave about the food and experience they have. I love the calamari and the scallops and shrimp. They also have the best drinks. I will be going back consistently!	4
734	I was in the mood for breakfast and stopped in.\nI was not disappointed.\nI was seated immediately and was able to promptly place my order.\nEverything came out hot and tasty.	3
735	Hate to give it up because I enjoy eating Breakfast here on the weekends when all the big names in the area are overcrowded with long waits. Great inexpensive food. Biscuits and gravy, homefries and ham and bacon all awesome! Owner and staff are friendly and efficient! Always great friendly service, hope you enjoy!	3
736	Have only been for lunch on 2 occasions.\n\nSalad and soup was great but it took awhile to get it. Not sure that would be good if I worked!	2
737	Went for lunch. My experience:\n\n-Ordered maduros. Waiter came back a little while later to say they didn't have any.\n-Waiter gave my boyfriend the wrong food, then got it and gave it to somebody at another table when he realized it.\n-My steak sandwich had one strip of meat, covering about half the bread. Tasted pretty much like I was just eating toasted bread. For $10.\n-Lukewarm fries on the side. \n-Asked the waiter if they had cortaditos (a sweetened espresso). He didn't know, checked with somebody else, said we actually meant something completely different, which couldn't be made till the bartender came in at 2.	0
738	After many red bull vodkas and whatever shots my friends were feeding me, my recollections of this place were limited to say the least.  At least, I remember up to the point where someone got freaky on me...whups, I didn't just say that.  Seriously though, great space, huge inside, with lots of energy, and a balcony for fresh air after shakin your booty all night long.  As mentioned, don't wait in line, flirt with the hotties, and have a great time!  What happens at Tao, stays at Tao!	4
739	We had $50 of Food & Beverage credit to kill at the Vdara and Market Cafe was one of the few choices.  My tuna melt was delicious and my bf's egg, cheese, and bacon bagel was not.  These items took 35 minutes to come out of the kitchen, which is pretty ridiculous.  We also ordered some tea, coffee, juice, and desserts to hit our $50 mark.  Apparently pre-packaged items (like salami, ice cream, or canned beverages) do not count.	2
740	Time to sweat! This place is hit or miss but I can't judge yet bcuz we still have the New Years Resolution Crowd in attendance! :)	3
741	After being prodded and pocked by my co-workers to get a kitchen pass, I finally went to the Flying Saucer.\nI get the concept.  I appreciate the effort but come on.... shouldn't you look good in a skimpy outfit if you are going to wear one?  I did not really expect great service and that was pretty clear.  Friendly enough but the overall IQ was rather low.\nI do give a huge nod to the beer selection and for that one reason I am likely to go back.	1
742	The place gets pretty crowded. The people working there were friendly. I tried one of their favorites - Picnic with sweet potato salad. The sandwich was very good. The salad on the other hand was simply too salty to go with the sandwich.	3
743	Jennifer Lynn has been my hair dresser and my kids hair dresser for years now.  She is very talented with cutting and coloring and always gives my whole family a great new do.. The salon is in a great location at Kierland also...	4
744	The prices were great, but they were out of stout...\n\nI was a bit crowded and that left the staff super spread out... Our table faced the kitchen door and it was obvious they only had two cooks in the kitchen, I wonder how the dining room got so croweded?  But for the price I don't mind having to wait for our food, beg for water and the check.\n\nI will say the people watching was priceless!  It looked like perhaps a convention of middle-aged mid-west salesmen had hit the place hard just before we were seated! Hilarious :)	2
745	This dog park is great for BIG and small pups! Located passed the railroad tracks on 18th St, just under the Birmingham Bridge. \n\nThe park is split into two sections, big pups and little pups (under 25lbs) which is great because my boyfriend and I have a chihuahua that is normally afraid of big dogs, so it's nice to be able to let her loose in the small dog section and her not be afraid or timid around the other pups. It is well equipped with benches and great landscaping, and has an amazing view of the river. A great way to spend an afternoon chillin with your favorite doggies! The park has a nice amount of trash cans, it may seem odd that I mention this but the dog park at Olympia Park on Mt. Washington is about 3X the size with no trash cans for doggie waste. \n\nOnly negative thing I would have to mention is this park can get pretty muddy! Especially near the entrances/exits. Don't go right after the rain!	4
746	You would have to be white or be with a white person to get good service around here.  I felt a racial tension when I was here last.	0
747	My boyfriend took me to Roka for dinner last night for my first experience with delicious Sushi. We ordered the vegetable tempura, sweet potatoes, and sweet corn which were all delightful. Additionally, I ordered the Skuna Bay Salmon and my boyfriend ordered the California Roll and Sashimi Chef Selection. My dish was perfectly delicious and Tim enjoyed his dinner as he always does when he visits Roka. \nThis turned out to be one of my favorite dinners out in quite some time!	4
748	I first found this restaurant when they first opened and had a great time there with great food.  Good tasting/friendly service.\n\nLast trip there was a flop.  Pho was lacking and 6 people in our party orded rice dishes.  The meat was mediocre and the tau-hu-ky smelled.  No one finished their soup and we couldn't eat the rice dishes.  I vow not to ever go back there.	0
749	The management at this place has no regard for it's patrons whatsoever. We came in for a Lunch buffet and the food selection was sub par to say the least. We were a group of 4 and we were treated with such disrespect that it is appalling. We tried using a yelp deal and not only were they unwilling to accept it they were very rude about telling us that it they cannot take it. The rest rooms at this place were the worst of all the restaurants in Vegas. I'd give no stars if I could.Avoid this place like a plague. There are much better Indian restaurants around	0
750	Ok I've been here about 10 or more times and I still love Rudy's the same as I first tasted them in Austin a few years ago. This place rules! Get the choice cut of brisket and try some smoked turkey and throw in a half link while your add it. You won't be disappointed. I've never been!  Overall my favorite BBQ here in Phx until I can be proven wrong. If this is not the best one in Phx, then it's one of them in almost everyone's list. I love Rudy's!	4
751	I have been here a few times and a friend and I had dinner there last night. We went during happy hour and the prices are great, probably the best you can find in the area! The rolls we had were good- tootsie, cali, and Vegas. We also had edamame, miso soup, and dumplings. Overall we were very pleased with the food! Our server was somewhat friendly but got short with us here and there. Not a huge deal, but it turned us off a bit and that's why I gave bei 4 out of 5 :)	3
752	Great food, great staff that will make anything you want.  All chicken dishes can be ordered as white meat only.	4
753	I love the Red Rock Casino, but the kids have ruined this theater.  If you must go, don't look down.  The carpets are gross and really need a change.  Otherwise, they always have a good selection of movies, an IMAX theatre, and they even have a party room if you'd like to throw one there.	0
754	"I ate here on my last night in Vegas and more or less enjoyed it. I felt really classy walking in with a t-shirt and bright red cargo shorts, but I'll be damned if I walk around the desert heat in pants.\n\nWe had to get the stone crab appetizer since it's in the damned NAME of the place, even though I did not like the ~26 dollar price at all. For that money, you get two fairly big claws, pre-cracked and served with Joe's sauce (not that kind, but the mustard kind). The crab tasted very good, and if you can afford it, then good for you and GIVE ME MONEY.\n\nThe stone crab bisque was extremely delicious - not too thick, and very savory. Maybe a bit too savory, but I'm someone who can't drink non-lowsodium veggie juice, so take that comment with a grain of salt HIYOOOO.\n\nI dined on pretzel-crusted arctic char with tarragon remoulade. Sounds fancy, I thought, but in reality it's just pretzel-crusted salmon with a nice tartar-like sauce. It still tasted good, although the fish was cooked a little rarer than I like.\nLe girlfriend had the fisherman's platter, which was a grilled combination of shrimp, scallops, octopus, and squid. The seafood was cooked well (except the squid was a tad chewy), and decently flavored.\n\nAdditionally, we had a side of \""Joe's grilled tomatoes.\"" Naturally, I thought that they were just ....grilled tomatoes. But they came out, and it turns out the slices are topped with some sort of spinach puree and AMERICAN CHEESE. EWW. A description of that crap on the menu would have been helpful.\n\nWould have loved to try the key lime pie, but we didn't dessert it up so we could have time to savor our last night in Vegas.\nIf you know what I mean ;)"	3
755	This store was close which is the only reason I ever went.  Thank goodness I recently moved and there is one closer with a much better staff.  However, this one....avoid if you can.  The staff is RUDE and like to chatter when there are customers in the store instead of helping them.  I lived down the street for five years so this isn't just a one time experience.  It happened almost every time.  The last few months there was one young girl (I can't remember her name, started with an A) that worked there that was super nice and sweet, they better keep her or they will keep getting bad reviews.	0
756	Been tattoo'd by Gianni for years and this shop and all that are in it are nothing but an extension of his greatness. Be smart get a great tattoo from this shop.	4
757	My friend and I went here for lunch the other day and it was a very interesting experience.  She was on her lunch break from work so she was in her uniform, a pretty obvious indication that we're going to be in a hurry.  We sit at the bar since it's pretty slow and that way would be able to order right away with the bartender.  She came over and took our drink orders then wandered off to go get them.  While she was doing that a group of about four guys came in and sat a few seats down from us.  They must have been very interested because they caused the bartender to completely forget about us.\n\n\nShe dropped off our drinks and rushed over to take their order.  A few minutes later she must have gotten the crazy idea that maybe we wanted something to eat as well so she asked if we wanted some menus.  Um, yeah...thanks for noticing!  She quickly took our order, taking time out in between to find out if the group of guys needed another round.  I'm sorry that it took us all of two minutes to tell you what we wanted to eat, next time we'll try to speed that up for you.\n\nOnce we finished my friend asked to have her food boxed up to take home.  Now, some restaurants have such great customer service that they actually box it up for you, other offer you different sizes and check to see if you need containers for condiments as well.  Here at the Fox and Hound they throw the box in front of you as they're hurrying to flirt with the group of guys sitting near you.\n\nNeedless to say we were less than thrilled with our lunch hour experience.  But at least now we know that if we want to have good service next time we just need to make sure that there are absolutely no men in the restaurant to distract the server!	1
758	Another quick lunch led me to this place. I headed straight to the drive-thru and ordered their lunch special: 4 tacos, a drink, and fries for $4.99. They get points for being quick (only waited about 5 minutes) and friendly. Unfortunately, that's about the best thing about this place. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 2 al pastor tacos. The tortillas were thick and gummy. The asada was dry and had little flavor. The al pastor was excessively greasy and the fries were forgettable. This might be good drunk food at 4 in the morning, but when you're sober... not so much.	1
759	Replacing Mickey's Hangover, Firehouse has done nothing but caused a bunch of memories with great people. Best days/nights to go? Any day ending in Y. I always run into someone I know and have never had an issue with anything or anybody. Super Josh Snyder is always the best at what he does and he's like a robot so his service is 2nd to none. The djs are always in the mix and always set the mood right. Christmas 2010, New Year's Eve 2011, My Birthday, Valentine's Day, my girl's Birthday, UFC Fights, Ortiz-Mayweather fight, ASU games, NFL Sundays and happy hour are just a few times that I've been there and have ALWAYS had a great time. Thank You Firehouse!	4
760	Went here with some friends before heading out to old town to club and it was incredible. Everyone ordered something different and we shared - and ALL of it was amazing. From the enchiladas to the fish tacos to even the rice and beans. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food so this is saying a lot. \n\nThe place itself was absolutely gorgeous, from the exterior to the interior. The seating both outside and inside is comfortable (we had moved from inside to outside seating just out of curiosity). Outside was nice because they had heaters since it was Winter, so we thought we might freeze but it was actually very comfortable. The chairs and couches were really nice as well and they had fire pits which you could dine next to (I loved that part). \n\nThe bathrooms were beautiful and clean and the service was also great. \n\nIt is a bit pricey but everything is delicious, so it's a give and take for sure. \n\nThe good thing about this place is that it's great for dates as well as friends and family.	4
761	Located by the West Garage in Town Square on the Boulevard.\n\nThe sweet potato fries and the nom-noms (fried mac n' cheese bites) are straight up. Nothing spectacular, but fried well.\n\nThe main event - the burger. I ordered the Inferno burger and my wife got the Oregon Trail. The beef is what makes this burger special, but it was far from special. It downright sucked. I ordered medium-rare and got well-done. My entire party of 12 got well-done burgers. The patty was under-seasoned or not seasoned at all. I guess that's how they do it over there. A Whopper is more satisfying than these burgers.\n\nI heard the shakes are great, but I'm not coming back to try them. I recommend going to SmashBurger or Five Guys for the $5-$8 burger price range.	1
762	"Very good and freshly prepared \""quick food\"" Greek/Med food, clean modern space with nice seating. I just moved into the neighborhood and was delighted to find Mika's...and find is the key word.  It is located in the Papago Plaza strip mall ( abit of 1950's Pueblo Kitsch) and like pretty much all the businesses there has no road signage.  It is on the southwestern side of the mall on the Scottsdale Road side.  Worth looking for!"	3
763	"Holy Atomic Pile of Sh!t Batman!!!!\nThis stuff sucks.... Like the previous reviewer I got sucked in by the commercials. Plus they were the only ones open at 9:50PM for delivery. Else we would have done Barro's Pizza, which by the way is awesome!\n\nYes the website makes the process look cool but it is 2010 and I know high school kids with flashplayer skills that can do the same thing.\n\nOn to the food review!\n\nWe ordered a thin crust cali bacon chicken ranch pizza with mild chicken wings, cheesy bread, and that chocolate crunch cake thingy. \n\nThe Pizza and Bread... Tasted like they put tons of salt on it. I was hoping that the additional green peppers, onioins, and mushroom would give it some flavor but I would not  have noticed they were there if I did not order it. The crust was all right but how do you screw up a thin-crust? Let's not hold them to that though...\n\nThe cheesy bread was cheesy, crappy, and salty all rolled into one. \n\nThe chicken wings were not as cooked as I would have liked which made it even more gross.  There was a lot of skin on them. GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!  I am not sure what kind of sauce they put on it but it looked like watered down ketchup and it just looked plain nasty. It did not look appetizing at all! On a normal day I can throw down a double order of wings with no problem but with this I only ate 2 pieces and said to myself \""what a waste of money.\"" \n\nThe chocolate crunchy thing tasted okay but it was very sweet. I might be diabetic now because of it. \n\nNext time it's late and no one is open for delivery then I will either starve or get my lazy as up and drive somewhere that is open. Considering In-n-Out and Denny's is right down the street from me I definitely wasted my money. \n\nIf you enjoy wasting money on pooh then by all mean go for it.\n\nI would give this place negative stars if I could."	0
764	Positives:  Right in the heart of everything. \nNegs:  Right in the heart of everything.\n\nClean enough and a bit dated but who goes to Madison to stay in the room? (although I don't want to think about the history of the towels I used).  So if drinking and partying and drinking more and listening to other people outside doing the same is what you are looking for... this room is great especially when you consider you will be blacked out within a few hours of check in.	3
765	"I decided to make a last minute trip to LV to join my family celebrating a birthday.  They were staying at the Bellagio for four nights.  I was only going to stay for two nights, and by the time I had decided to go the Bellagio rates were higher than I wanted to pay for given the quick stay over.  Since Planet Hollywood was just across the street from the Bellagio, and the rate seemed reasonable, I decided to stay there.\nI won't say that it was a horrible experience, but I was definitely disappointed.  The rooms are dated and didn't feel exceptionally clean.  The decor has a 1990's vibe to it.  I'm not sure how much of it is carryover from the Aladdin revamp prior, but it wasn't up to what I would consider \""current Strip standards\"".  It seems appropriate that this is Britney Spears anchor arena for her shows - it has a slightly \""trashy\"" feel to it. \nSome of the issues that I had regarding the room were:\n- missing front of one of the drawers\n- strange odor from the faucet water in sink\n- pull chain shades that kept sticking\nI can see being in my 20's and coming here to have a raging time, but those days are a little bit behind me at this point and would rather opt for comfort and modern amenities (like at Aria) than \""just a place to crash\"" at the end of a long night."	0
766	"Fun B.B.Q. to visit in Kitchener-Waterloo.\n\nMy partner and I visited for lunch and enjoyed their \""family\"" pit platter, with sides of fresh cut fries, beer battered onion rings, cornbread, collard greens, coleslaw, et cetera, all washed down with Ontario craft brews.  Wine list features very affordable Ontario wines.\n\nFriendly service, live music at nights, atmospheric decor.  One can't go wrong dining/drinking here."	3
767	Place looked cool from the outside so thought we'd check it out. We were seated in the lounge section which was empty. \n\nSo we were waiting for 20 minutes until I decided to actually go and call a waiter to take our order.\n\nIt's a lounge so it's supposed to be lively right? Nope. The place had no music playing and again, after becoming sick of the dead atmosphere I asked for them to turn the music on.\n\nThe waiter came with our order and it's a 5 star restaurant so your expect a little hospitality or good service. Waiter might as well have thrown the drinks at us. No napkins, didn't even pour the bottle for us.\n\nLastly, the sound system (AFTER we asked for the music to be turned on) kept popping and making these loud exploding noises which was unnerving.\n\nThe only good part of this place is that they have pretty girls serving you but they're too busy looking at themselves in the mirror rather than taking your order.	0
768	When I saw the name of this establishment, Blue Hound, I couldn't help but thing of the paintings of George Rodrigue, who is from Louisiana and in fact, this downtown based eatery has a distinctive New Orleans feel with its focus on cocktails (according to drinking lore the Big Easy is where the first cocktail, the Sazerac, was reportedly developed), and its Southern friendly food such as bone-in Kobe beef short ribs and grits and Kentucky fried quail with cornbread, red beans and gravy. At the same time the decor and the initial impression was like walking into a bar as good as any as one might find in New York City, this place has cool atmosphere in spades and just for that it is worth a visit.\n\nI was going to to the opera (for the first time, yep, an opera virgin, who would have thought!) with some friends so we picked this place to eat at first. I had ridden the light rail from Tempe and you get off the stop at Washington and Central and literally, you are right there, so this place is extremely light rail friendly. You go to the building on the corner of Jefferson and Central and up to the 2nd floor, turn to your right and you are there! The opening leads into a long bar and the best part of this place, which is the cocktails. They must have a cocktail ice machine because the ice cubes are huge and perfect for drinks like the old fashioned as they keep the liquor cold but don't water down the drink and the old fashioned, I got it for the happy hour price of $6 and that is great deal. They have a whole book of cocktails and I haven't seen anything like this since I was in San Francisco earlier this year, which is sort of a cocktail renaissance mecca.  From what I saw Blue Hound can hold its own. If you just want to come for cocktails - 5 starts\n\nDinner, well, they seem to be trying but needs some work. It was noted that we needed to get the opera by 7:30 but the waiter seemed a bit aimless at times relative to keeping us on schedule and one of my dining companions was quite concerned that we would not have time to finis the meal. Luckily, there was a wonderful young lady who checked on us, and got our orders taken so that helped keep things running smoothly. For an appetizer, we had the duck confit flat-bread which came out wonderful hot and topped with arugula and green apple diced through a mandolin, it was delicious though two of my dining companions felt it needed more confit. \n\nWe then did a salad and vegetable and i had a small dish of roasted cauliflower with pistachios, capers, and brown butter, and I thought it was quite good though I would have liked the cauliflower a little more roasted but nice - at this point, a solid 4 stars. \n\nAs for the meals, three of us ordered the Kentucky fried quail and while it was okay, it did not come hot, the fried quail was room temperature, the gravy was not all that warm and the cornbread, almost cold and it was little bland. It was the blah part of my meal. Another person had scallops and though large and cooked perfectly she noted they needed some sort of sauce, also a bland dish. Finally, one person got the Kobe bone in rib, the half order, with the blue cheese grits, now that came out hot and it was good - so at this point - because of the slower than expected service from the primary waiter, and the fact that the main dish was blah - the overall agreement by my group of five (mixed group, men and women), was a solid 3 stars though if you just came for cocktails and appetizers (and they have a good list of starters) then we would rate it a solid 4 starts with 5 star potentials if they work on the operational workflow of the kitchen to get the food out hot.\n\nOh, one final point, I could not figure out how to work  the salt and pepper shakers, the waiters might want to point out how those work. Bottom line, I probably won't go back for a full meal here but I will come back in a heartbeat for the wonderful cocktail and drink selection and the small plates, which may be the way to go. In my mind, this is about the closest  thing to a cool cocktail bar, like you might find in New York or San Francisco, that one is going to find and the location off of the light rail and big events in downtown Phoenix can't be beat and yes, I'm already looking forward to my next old fashioned at the bar!	2
769	I have to search long and hard for things in this store that don't expire the day I'm purchasing them. They don't have a lot of the things they offer in their weekly ad, which I try to plan my grocery list around. The lines are always SUPER long. The store is always dirty. I keep telling myself I'll go to another store but there isn't another one in the 'hood to go to, so I'll need to make a better plan to head further away for a better experience in another chain. I've tried to talk to assistant managers about my issues at the store and have been blown off or they act afraid and stutter a lot. \n\nThe only good news: The gentlemen that bag groceries and collect carts are VERY nice and helpful.	0
770	Never disappointed eating here. Friendly service, hot and fantastic tasting food.  I especially like the spicy chicken bowl.  You can have it with a fountain drink for under $6, what a bargain.\nI want to try their breakfast one day.	4
771	Pretty tasty coffee and local owned and operated if I am not mistaken	2
772	Kevin and Tammy seem super nice. Christine has a nasty attitude she does a horrible job. She does not know how to speak to costumers. She really is a b.tch. Tammy had to redo them. Never going back! .	1
773	My children love coming  for dinner here. Always great food and tasty desserts! I love their coconut shrimp - ymmy :-)	3
774	I went to this place with a family member upon their recommendation.  \n\nThe salad was amazing!  I forget exactly what it is called (cowboy chopped salad I think?) .  Firstly it's gorgeous (comes in rows of the ingredients which are beautiful colors; arugula, tomatoes, pepitas, dried currents, chicken, asiago cheese, and dried corn for some crunch)  Then when it gets to your table they pour on the dress (a creamy dressing with a slight basil taste to it), and it all gets mixed together.  \n\nI believe it usually comes with salmon instead of chicken but we ordered ours with chicken and it was a great fit, I highly suggest it. \n\nThe rest of the menu looked amazing too, but I'm not sure I could go there and not get the salad.  So I suggest going with multiple people, splitting the salad and then splitting another entree.  \n\nThe decor of the place could probably use a little sprucing up and it's a bit on the cheesy side.  \n\nService wise was unfortunately not the greatest experience.  It was a slow time and we had a hard time getting our bill or being asked if we needed anything else.  Thus the deduction of a star.  But I would still give it another try just for the food.	3
775	"Disappointing.  All told, none of the tapas plates were that good.  Most were either boring or a little too salty.  While nothing was too terrible (except for the special of the night), none of the ingredients seemed to really go together exactly right.  Most dishes came with 3 pieces of the tapas - I think I would have preferred a lower price for 2 pieces or higher for 4 (and yes, I understand tapas means \""small plates\""!) We will not be planning a return trip in the near future unless I hear some new raving reviews or they change their menu around.  \n\nMy bf and I went to V. Picasso on a Saturday night.  We were really excited to try this place!  The night started out with a moderately long wait for our waitress. Once she arrived, she could not even tell us what the specials were and practically forgot them again when she came back to us after reading them - but we were fine with it.\n\nWe ordered 8 tapas plates.  First out was the free cream of zucchini soup - yay - I love free anything!  It was pretty good.  We also each had a red sangria which we found tasty.  The night was off to a pretty good start...until the food we ordered started to arrive.  I'm trying to remember everything we had:\n\nJerk Rubbed Duck (The Special of the Day) - Most disappointing of all. We actually had this one second to last but since it was pretty terrible, I thought I'd review it first.  When something is on special, I would hope that it would at least be ok...but not this time.  We received 4 or 5 quarter size pieces of duck, each with a large rim of fat around it.  There was no jerk-rubbed taste, probably because the pieces were too small to get anything on them.  Waste of $8.\n\nSalt Cod Fritters - Alright.  Too salty.\n\nMarinated Olives - Blah, they seemed like they were just olives out of the jar with no special marinade, and they weren't served with any bread or anything.  (A previous reviewer mentioned them being marinated with manchego - ours were unfortunately not done that way.) Very salty.\n\nGambas al mole - I enjoyed the shrimp themselves, but I was not impressed with the mole or the corn puree in the dish.  Both were boring. The mole was spicy, but there wasn't much of a taste to it.  \n\nGrilled zucchini with honey, etc. - This was good, but I felt like another veggie with more flavor would have made the dish even better.  Nonetheless, I liked the goat cheese and honey taste.  (Although this dish now looks different than the picture that another reviewer provided.)\n\nChorizo con Huevos - This dish was one egg on top of three pieces of bread with a sweetish tomato sauce/paste with chorizo chopped into it.  The chorizo was very disappointing - it tasted like chopped up hillshire farm sausage, with no spice to it.  My bf kept questioning whether it was really chorizo.  The tomato paste on the bread was actually nice...but the dish itself just did not seem like it went together well.\n\nPatatas Bravas - Alright, they were just lightly fried cut up potatos with a spicy sauce.  Salty again.  Easy to make on your own.\n\nChurros with chocolate sauce - I liked this, because who can really argue with cinnamon-sugar covered fried dough with chocolate sauce!?  However, one of the three churros sticks was not fully cooked inside.   \n\nWe left disappointed and unsatisfied with our meal."	1
776	If you need to have a sleep study done this is the place to have it done. With 5 sleep centers throughout the valley there was a sleep center not far from where we were staying. The facility is absolutely beautiful.The rooms are like a resort with the staff as nice as can be and very knowledgeable.  My daughter had the best experience here.	4
777	Come hungry! Leave happy! Awesome place never seen like this fine sushi restaurant!!!	4
778	YUM! I love their vegetable broth and garnishes and everything! Great service(FAST) and great food! What more is there to say?	4
779	"It's amazing that no matter what me and my family do we can't walk out the door for no less than $30. The food is good , not great. The new cost cutting measures include the servers putting ALL ICE in your cups and 10% soda , and putting a layer of cheese so thin on the pizzas that it's stupid. New employees , same complete idiot type. A girl who came to our table on the same night , served us 2 different pizzas that we didn't order. Then she seemed like she was \""disrespected\"" when we pointed out that the pizza's weren't the ones we ordered. Just save your money. I agree with tabatha , I've lost about 20 pounds since I've stopped eating at major food chains that have taken gross amounts of cost cutting. There's more cheese on the pizzas from the taco bell menus that have pizza hut. Seriously! you get more cheese on that little pre made pizza that comes from the PH factory that what they put on the pizzas when they're making them \""fresh\"". Last one I had smelt like corn chips at this location.\n\nsave your money."	1
780	"My three star review is based on THIS location of the Presto Cafe, compared to the original Rainbow location. I have tried several items and while I love what Presto serves, I am disappointed in the amount of inconsistency that continues to be an issue with this location. \n\nThe first couple of times I ordered here, everything was great- coworkers were happy with their meals, my husband was happy with some items that I got for him to-go. I will also say that while my recent experiences with lunch have been hit or (mostly) miss, I have NEVER had an issue with the morning breakfast bowl or the opening staff.\n\nI've run into some items being unavailable, and some employees let me know I can wait for the item to be made if I want, while others simply say \""no, we are out, sorry, is there something else you want to order?\"" The same employee that abruptly said \""no,\"" was one that saw my ticket come up the first time the girl who rang me up said she could make more salad if I was able to wait, and told her in the kitchen, \""we are out of that salad, why did you ring it up?\"" I guess I would understand had I tried to order at 8PM, but I've never stopped into a Presto later than 5. Or if they were out of an ingredient, just say that. I'm not going to get mad about them running out of a fresh ingredient.\n\nSide note: The \""no\"" guy was also one who I've witnessed tucking his shirt back into his pants or wiping his brow with food prep gloves on, using the same knife or preparation tools on different ingredients, etc. He just screams \""food safety nightmare.\"" His language, while not offensive to me, is definitely not what I would consider appropriate for the environment that Presto has, where the whole kitchen is open for patrons to see.\n\nI have also had issues with quality. I've had pides that were burnt (as others complained of), and I've had perfect ones. I've had completely different serving sizes of the no-pasta lasagna, along with undercooked, crunchy sweet potato in some pieces, or with no seasoning and no kale, and the next time it will be spot on. Today, I received a to-go order of the lasagna that was cold in the middle when I bit into it about five minutes after receiving it.\n\nIn contrast, the Rainbow location has never even been out of anything for me to know whether the staff are helpful/willing to make more of a dish if possible. The quality of the dishes is extremely consistent, and I've never had anything over or undercooked. The Rainbow location gets five stars from me. The Henderson location, while close to work, is always a crap shoot as to whether or not my dish will be as expected or cooked properly, and whether the staff will be helpful or disengaged."	2
781	"You know what? This place ain't half bad. At least not as bad as how all the reviewers have been making it look like. But it seems like everyone is bitching about the general \""inexperience\"" of the security staff above anything else. I got let in pretty quickly and even had a nerdy stocky lady bouncer give phone directions to my friends over my phone without attitude or trouble.\n\nIf you read my other reviews, you know it's very difficult for me to speak positively on stuff like this in general. So congratulations Hakkasan! You didn't piss me off! And you put a smile on my face!\n\nAsians almost never smile!\n\nHowever, we did have comped tables thanks to a friend that has close connections with the senior staff in this venue. So I am reviewing this place based on a pretty concise VIP treatment. \n\nOur host is fairly attentive and so is her busser. Never, once, have I ever needed to ask her to fill my drink when I was going dry. Which was a issue I had at 1-Oak where I had to fill my own glasses.\n\nThe best way I can describe Hakkasan is that it's just like Tao. It has a Asian theme, and has a restaurant downstairs. However, it is not as douchy as Tao. Now given, I seen a few catfights between girls jump off right in front of me in the hip hop room, and this being my first day, it does embarass and make the club look bad. But hey, at least I didn't get into a fight for the bathroom line like I did in Tao (read my Tao review), because there are more than FOUR bathrooms with NO LINES!\n\nAnother reviewer is complaining about the \""bitchiness\"" of Asian girls in the club. Personally, I never had this problem because not only do I NOT talk to random Asian girls that are looking for their rich White Knight with a green card, but I have my own friend circle of hot Asians with me :p \n\nThe key is building your hot friend networks OUTSIDE the party scene, because anyone who thinks that they can get laid on the first night of meeting a girl at a club will just catch a nasty case of herpes, and HIV if they are unfortunate (:\n\nI enter the club with people I know, and leave the club with the same folks. And for anyone I met that night, ill hit them up the next day after giving them time to think about me (:\n\nThat's how you stay safe, and not missing any kidneys the next morning!"	3
782	"I am a platinum Starwood member.  I have stayed at timeshares before so if this is the basis of comparison this is a great place.  Rooms are well maintained and the accessibility to the lazy river at the resort is great for families  However, if you are coming to this property accustomed to a \""Westin experience\"", this is a let down.  They definitely treat timeshare owners differently (read not as good) than hotel resort guests.  The special attention and treatment of preferred Starwood members is significantly less on the villa side.  This is especially evident with the reception where they treat you like potential fresh bait until you let them know you're not looking to buy.  STARWOOD MEMBERS BEWARE don't waste your points or your money, you will be disappointed.\n\nI will not stay here again and conduct better research in future to ensure  that I don't stay at any of the Starwood timeshare resorts."	1
783	My experience here is not one that has a lot to cover. I was pretty much in and out here so I can't really give a glowing report. Usual fashion the better restaurants are in the main terminal and if you head out to security you end up on one of the satelites and then you have limited selections. I do wish that there were more connections ports for power as many people were wainting in line to power their various mobile devices. I have been in many a better airport than this, nothing overly negative, just nothing to write home about.	1
784	An elegant, small shopping and dining venue that I wish would catch on a bit better. It's much more tasteful and appealing than Downtown Summerlin. It also has ample parking and easy access.\n\nIf you're looking for a classy shopping experience in a mall that's easy to navigate and has great restaurants, check out Tivoli Village.	4
785	I was at the Starbucks in the Trails Village Center and needed to stop at the ATM at Wells Fargo.  There wasn't a single car in any of the three lanes even the one with the ATM.  That's almost 4 stars without thinking.\n\nThis is an OK place, but it's not in my neighborhood and it's a bit of a pain getting in and out with the traffic coming in and out of the Trails Center.\n\nI have lived here over a decade and this is my first check in here says something.	2
786	I was a bit worried about using Sixt due to some the really brutal reviews here on yelp, but I have to say it was an excellent experience.  I came into Phoenix late on a Wednesday night, and saw that the line was pretty long at the three small rental car places that share a booth.  As I walked up though, the lines were for the other two places, not Sixt.  I walked up and was out the door in my car in about 10 minutes.  The price was fair, about the same as all the other rental agencies.  Where Sixt really wins is that they have some very fun cars for rent.  For the same price as a Chevy Malibu at one of the other rental places, I was able to have my choice of a Mercedes CLA, or an Audi A3.  I picked the CLA, and had a shiny black Mercedes with sunroof, for a long weekend.  The car had about 2,000 miles on it and still had that new car smell.  Dropping off was easy, the whole experience could not have gone better, I will use them again.	4
787	"It's Wal-Mart and it does not disappoint.  This store location just opened recently and I thought, \""well, it's somewhat close to ASU, maybe it'll have a different vibe than the typical Wal-Mart experience I'm used to.\""\n\nNope\n\nIt's your standard issue Wal-Mart with your standard issue merchandise at those low low prices Wal-Mart's famous for.\n\nIt also still draws the same type of customers.  They're the ones we've all come to know and love at www.peopleofwalmart.com.  If you're looking for an environment where kids scream out the numbers they know (and failing to exceed 5...I'm serious), if part of your shopping experience includes the oblivious blocking every isle, and if you are enamored by the grandma pace cars you have to follow to get up to the front, then this is the Wal-Mart for you."	2
788	Man I LOVE this place! I really hope they do well! You will not find better Mexican food and a more laid back relaxed atmosphere!!! They only thing they need to do is put sand on the floor! Great beer and booze selections! I will be back again and again.	4
789	Contrary to some of the previous reviews, I think that this place is absolutely great! The venue itself has a lot of character and provides a nice atmosphere to dine in as well as casually sip on drinks in a bar/sushi bar setting.\n\nThe food in particular has a very unique fusion for many of the Asiatic countries, providing dishes for any patron to enjoy. I am personally fond of their combination Vietnamese sandwich. IMHO it is the best sandwich in Phoenix. Fresh cilantro, pickled veggies and a sizable amount of grilled beef, pork and chicken. Their soups are right on the money- however, from experience it is much better when eaten there rather than ordered for pick up. \n\nThey have come a long way since opening with their happy hour options, and have a good variety of beers on tap. Some remodeling seems to be in process with a separate libations bar next to the beer 'island' bar, and an area offset for those who wish to smoke! \n\nHaving seen some staff turnover, it seems management is getting their act together of having good servers and bartenders. But what I am most excited for is the prospect of having a new live music venue to watch shows and local artists perform! According to their public notice- they have received zoning approval by the city to host more shows, later in the evening! \n\nGiven its location, it's odd how more people don't frequent this place. Granted, with competitors who have a strong following very close by, it shows that the only thing missing from Pallets is a distinguishing factor that makes them unique! I think with the pursuit of their new music platform, the crowd following is only going to rise!! If I could have given it 4 and a third or 4 and a half stars I most likely would have, but in the end the sandwich takes the cake. Sooo delicious. \n\nTL;DR\n\nAwesome restaurant with delicious food and good drink specials, in an up and coming area of metro Phoenix. Paired with a unique atmosphere, excellent location and ample space, Pallets has a lot going for them and the opportunity to grow seems on par with the area. The only thing missing to make this a solid 5stars is a crowd. It's nice going out to a lively place to meet new people, but the following just isn't there yet. I don't doubt that come a year from now the place will have found their core patrons and the jovial atmosphere will follow.	4
790	"The first time I was at the Cosmo, Jaleo looked like the place to be...it felt the same so my coworker & I settled for this restaurant for a Sunday evening dinner.  We were able to get seated immediately, which wasn't the case at other restaurants nearby.  \n\nMy \""geeky\"" coworker was impressed w/ the bar menu available via iPad!\nWe had a couple of staff approach our table both offering different recommendations which is probably a good thing...Overall, service was kinda weird.  We felt like our waitress gave us weird looks after leaving our table.  And we didn't have any weird or off the wall requests.  \nI ordered the Sangria - it was served with fruit already in the glass, it was ok.  My coworker didn't mention a peep of the Shirley Temple.  \nWe shared a bunch of dishes from the extensive menu.  \nPan Con Serrano - probably the best dish of the evening\nSetas al Ajillo\nTomato Salad\nSopa Ajo Blanco\nDatiles\nLobseter Paella\nRape Donostiarra\n\nNothing really stood out and we ordered a lot of food!  We perused the dessert menu but nothing stood out and we were way too full."	2
791	Yes. This is a great place for slightly higher quality bar food.  The portions are large and the service is great.\n\nThis was a pre-concert spot to satisfy hunger and booze needs and it did the job.  A great spot for large groups, I believe happy hour specials as well.\n\nLobster Roll for the win! \n\nI highly recommend checking out this spot, you will be happy.	3
792	"WORST HOTEL SERVICE!! Called 3 weeks in advance and spoke with manager regarding shuttle availability for the duration of my stay and was told 24/7. Called before my flight took off and once I landed in Vegas....NO SHUTTLE WAITING. After 45+ minutes I decided to take a cab to my already late appointment. After work I wanted to go to the strip and eat dinner but the shuttle was \""at the airport waiting\""....took a cab. After dinner wanted to go back to my hotel but the shuttle was what? You guessed it....at the airport waiting. Every time I called or asked it was at the airport and unavailable yet when I was at the airport it was no where to be found. I think the fact that I called to advance my trip, called before my flight took off, and called once I landed just makes it worse. Oh and no understanding from the staff about the situation. I will never stay at any Hampton Inn again and neither will anyone I work with."	0
793	Disappointing at best. Ribs were dry, sides were sub par, service was average, neighborhood was one step up from Demascus. Not to mention the fact that the building looks like it's about to burn down and there's probably several health code violations. I drove across town to eat here because the reviews were so good and regret my decision.	1
794	"My husband and I branched out to a new restaurant this weekend (Coronado Cafe in Phoenix) - our experience is why we don't like to branch out to new restaurants.  For starters, the host sat us and said \""we have a party coming in at 7pm; do you think you will be done by then?\""  After that warm welcome we found our water glasses had lipstick on them (both of the glasses).  We ordered the bruschetta (pretty good); my husband had the bacon/cheese burger and I had the meatloaf sandwich.  Burger was good, sandwich was very mediocre.  For the money and the food, we probably wouldn't go back.  The inside of the restaurant was very charming but that is about the extent of what impressed us."	1
795	"This place is a spot we have past for the last couple years and finally decided to give this bar a shot. When walking in there are two entrances, one leads to the bar while the other goes to the sit down restaurant area. The menu has a \""Mardi Gras, New Orleans\"" vibe.. however the food has nothing to do with quality Louisiana  cooking other than names. I tried the chicken finger appetizer with the Stupid sauce which is basically blended habaneros and vinegar. The chicken fingers were 6.95 and came with 4 fingers, two pieces of celery and two carrot pieces.. THATS IT!! .. not worth 6.95.... I then tried the fish and chips for dinner and it came with 3 small pieces of fish that were cooked fair, fries that were very generic, and god-awful slaw. These were 7.95 and also not worth it. Wife tried the Mushroom Burger which came with garlic fries .. Burger was good and cooked medium and fries were generic with tons of garlic salt on them. I tried the Jambalaya and it tasted like perfume and was bland. \n\nOverall the food was very generic and the portions were skimpy and prices on some thing were not worth it. With that being said the drink prices are fair and not bad. I tried a bloody mary which came in a nice big glass and tasted good for only 2.50. The server did a fine job as she was running tables at restaurant side and also bartending. I would not give this place a 2nd try for food however I would think it was a good spot to grab a quick drink."	1
796	Ah. This place kills me......for two reasons. Firstly, it USED to be amazing...Then all of a sudden, the quality of the food and service kind of crashed. And secondly, what kind of restaurant DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO TAKE YOUR FOOD TO GO?!??! This is the reason I won't be back. I had gone there with a friend, and we ordered and appetizer to share and then a main dish each. I had the veal with mushroom sauce which in the past was pretty amazing. However, halfway through that dish, I got full (shocking, I know). At the end of our meal, both of us asked for the rest of our dishes to be packed to go and we were told by a very unhappy woman that this would not be possible. Either eat it all here, or too bad. It was SHOCKING. So.....although the food is ok, I won't be returning here. I don't like feeling ripped off, and the fact that they won't give you the rest of your paid-for food, makes me feel totally ripped off.  :|	2
797	my first Burberry purchase was on 5\\29/2014 I mistakenly purchased a ll maydown MCO Bla46 which was on sale for $595 formerly $750. It was cute with two tassels in front with a snap button closure. I was told by the sales person that I needed to take the purse on the floor because they were no others. After getting home I immediately took the tags off of a purse. After filling the purse with various items I noticed that the latch was hard to secure. After leaving Las Vegas I went to San Francisco and left a purse in Las Vegas at a family member's house on my return to Las Vegas on June 24th 2014. I decided that I would return the purse due to the problems with the closure. When I attempted to return the purse to the store for my  full refund I was told that's because the purse with on sale I only had 14 days for a refund additionally I was told that the purse was not in resalable condition due to the fact that the price tag had been removed. After talking to managers and Customer service it was determined that the store was in fact justified in their decision to refuse a refund or store credit for the purse. I feel that if i had I known that the purse and had a 14 day return policy I might have not purchases a sale item.\n I would have never taken the tag off immediately until I was sure that the bag was fully functional. I feel it you can get better service at Walmart you have 30 day return policy and all you really need is a receipt I'm sure Louis Vuitton does not have such a shallow policy. Burberry can never match\n up to louis Vuitton and maybe this is one of the reasons why you live and you learn.\n\n..\n.	0
798	Great show!! If you like the Beatles you'll love this show. Drinks are kind of expensive but tasty and full of alcohol. Show starts off slow but picks up steam as it moves along. Acrobatics are incredible and the dancing adds the right touch. Definitely worth the price of admission.	3
799	I usually come here for trivia. The food is actually really good. Typical bar food, but it tastes great. Prices are reasonable. Gluten-free options for the man. \n\nBeer selection used to be better. Substantially less cider than they had a year ago. \n\nStaff is always friendly. \n\nHipster crowd, but they found it before it was cool so let them stay.	3
800	"I love independent/art/documentary/not-mainstream movies, so consequently, Camelview is one of my favorite spots as they are one of the few theaters here in the valley that gets these films.\n\nPositive things about the theater: \n*Great movies! \n*Friendly employees\n*Reasonably sized drinks (movie theater \""bucket-o-cola\"" drinks are a pet peeve of mine and their small is equivalent to a medium soda from a fast food restaurant, which is just perfect) \n*Yummy cinnamon almonds for sale at the concession stand\n*A retro-y feel \n\nNegatives\n*Older theater that feels a bit rundown\n*No stadium seating\n*Seats that are not particularly comfortable\n\nPoint of note (not positive or negative)\n*because of the type of movies they show, it seems like it is often popular with an older crowd of moviegoers. This can make for a sortof unique moviegoing experience if you come from a different demographic.\n\nIt is a fun spot that we manage to visit every couple of months. I wish that there were more options for Art films here in the Valley, but for the moment I do love Camelview, because I don't really have a choice in the matter ;)"	3
801	Not Montreal's only cookbook and food lit specialty bookstore, but certainly its best.  A large collection of books in English and French (but mostly English) + a full-service kitchen makes Appetite for Books an ideal location for culinary book launches and cooking classes, and they don't hold back.  Check out their website for a complete list of upcoming events, and act fast if you see something you like--their series of events is very, very popular.	4
802	Got in for free since we stayed at the Venetian.  Pretty convenient since we just prepartied in our rooms and came downstairs to dance.  \n\nThey played awesome music the whole night and the service was pretty good (bouncers were polite).  Only gripes were that the boys were just sooooo grabby.  They figure that since they got a booth and give you a drink, they have the rights to touch you.  Ummmm, no.  \n\n I just enjoyed the music, danced the night away, stayed close to my friends.  I would go here again if it was free.	3
803	Food was borderline satisfactory & service was horrible. I ordered a teriyaki bowl, miso soup & large drink. I asked if I could get my teriyaki 5-10 minutes after my soup so it won't get cold while I'm enjoying my soup course. I asked this because in past visits they would arrive at the same time.  They arrived at the same time again. \n\nI also informed them that they were out of iced tea. They didn't seem to care. An hour later, still no tea. They made no effort to make tea. It takes 5 minutes to brew tea.	1
804	I saw this show while I was in Vegas for Thanksgiving. Mom and I were looking for shows that were going on, and there weren't that many. But Legwarmers caught I am a big fan of the 80s, even though I was born in the 80's. I did think it was a bit cheesy at some parts, but it was enjoyable to a point. Don't think I'll be coming back soon though.	2
805	It has become quite difficult to find an old school barber shop that uses straight razors.  I'm an old school kind of guy.  It's a haircut, not a spa day.  I don't need my hair massaged and shampoo'd or any of that junk.\n\nVillage Barber does a good job.  I've had 3 different people and all have been fine.  An older gentleman, a man in his forties, and an Asian woman.\n\nRating a barbershop can be kind of hard as everyone who walks in the door has different needs.  But yeah, no problems with this place at all.  The price is reasonable.  The only downside I can think of is that they don't take debit or credit cards.	3
806	A famous restaurant. Good service, very juicy and tender steak. While, the beer collection is not so good. Almost only canned beers are available (I just saw one beer tap there, which is not on the menu).	2
807	old school Vegas there's not to Many of these left.Portions and food are great for the price (All I'm saying is the food is good for the price) The bar is a bit older the bar tenders are nice and easy to talk to and the beer and shots  are cheap  good place for the money only cons are the smoke (it gets in your cloths) and the occasional boulder highway scum that ventures in.	4
808	Stopped in for a few appetizers and had a nice time.  Bartender was very friendly and recommended the pigs in a blanket and wings.  Both were great!  Go for wings over pigs, if needed.  Nice portions for each.  Wings are done French style so they are soooo easy to eat.  I want all my wings like this for the future.	4
809	Pretty tasty bbq for sure, but the service was pretty slow (but did seem like they also had a catering gig at the same time).  Tender pork, good flavor and a sauce with gentle spice.  Good fries, the Mac and Cheese was just ok thou.  Good review on the coleslaw from table mate.  The sweet sauce seems to have more spice vs. their original.  We'll be back for sure to a nice family owned place.	3
810	I have been here twice and my first experience was pretty pleasant although I kind of felt like I was being watched closely by the security guard, like I was going to steal something. It made me feel very uncomfortable and if I was ever going to steal any thing from that store it would have been the nail polish which was located at the register. There really is nothing in here I couldn't live without but I did find a really cute cardigan for my nephew. The employees were pleasant while they were checking me out but the whole time the security guard stood by the register watching but not watching (if that makes sense). Really ackward!\n\nMy second visit (same day but later) was to exchange the cardigan I bought for my nephew for a bigger size. There was the same security guard standing around and only one worker who told me she was a new employee. I let her know I just needed to exchange the cardigan for a bigger size and she told me that she couldn't do exchanges or returns and I would have to wait for the store manager to get back from her lunch. I asked how long and she said about 15 more minutes. So I went back out to my car and sat for 20 minutes just so I could exchange this cardigan! I was upset that I had to wait so long just to do an exchange when I bought the cardigan earlier in the morning. Although the store manager was polite when doing the exchange, she never apoligized for making me wait around for 20 minutes.\n\nHow can you leave an employee on their own when they do not know or have any authority to do exchanges or returns?!\n\nIt will be awhile before I ever go back to this store if ever.	1
811	No longer serving food :/ and not a huge selection of smoothies...\n\nStill nice to take advantage of a smoothie after a VegasHot! class.	2
812	"I love trying out a new sushi place. I wished it was a bit better for me.\n\nArmed with an Amazon deal I purchased for $20 for $40 worth of food, we arrived for dinner on a Saturday night. Not very busy...\n\nOur server and sushi chef was friendly and helpful. As we looked at the menus handed to us and the monitor they had set up with pictures showing a slideshow of their sushi selections, we asked about their rolls. Our server knew some, yet still turned to ask most of what we asked to the sushi chef. I guess the new menu was new to them, too...?? \n\nWe ordered the Shufflin Roll recommended by our server and the James Special. Both were tasty, yet just had a lot going on. Couple different kinds of sauces, different fishes, sometimes a dish has too many things going on. I saw something called Taco Wasabi on their specials board, so I requested one. It was pretty much tako (octopus) chopped in a small bowl with wasabi mixed in. Do not recommend ordering that.\n\nWhen I presented my phone to use my Amazon deal, another employee came to settle our check so we can pay what's leftover after our voucher. I saw our check (what we would've paid) and saw that it added up to about $32. I'm not saying they were obligated to tell us, but all I was thinking was \""Wouldn't that have been nice that they could've told us we still had $8 to use???\"" Or at least tell us what our balance was at. I'm not one to care if we go over a certain amount, especially using a voucher, because I knew we already got a deal. Anyone else understand where I'm coming from?? LOL\n\nI hate giving less than 3 stars, seeing that others did enjoy this place. Maybe I'll try again and write an update..."	1
813	"I guess this is the one at 75th&Cactus-thats the one I'm looking for. Anyway, got all these coupons for free food. (in mail I think) Went in to get a free\""western burger\"" for hubby. He wanted to try it. All he said was \""It was good.\"" I mean he likes his burger with just cheese, no bacon, onion rings, etc. But he ate it all, he just said he is a simple man who likes simple food like a simple cheeseburger. NOTE: I like Carl's - my grandkids do too and thats a plus for you! Oh and we usually have great experiences with service. And NO, I am not compensated in any way from Carl's."	2
814	Went there for a birthday party - the service was pretty ok. But the food serving was just unsatisfactory for the price. For the same price, I could have gotten a similar order but twice as much food. Nice location - but the kitchen needs to get on top of things.	2
815	Un classique pour regarder le soccer ou le football sur \u00e9cran g\u00e9ant. Parfait comme endroit quand il y a plusieurs matches simultan\u00e9ment  (exemples : qualifications de la Coupe du monde de soccer, Ligue des champions ou derni\u00e8res semaines de la saison de la NFL) et qu'on souhaite garder un \u0153il sur ce qui se passe un peu partout. Bonne ambiance pendant les matches importants. Pendant la Coupe du monde 2010, j'y ai eu le plaisir de d\u00e9jeuner en regardant le match d'ouverture. Un des rares endroits qui ouvrent lorsque des matches ont lieu \u00e0 des heures inhabituelles ici.	4
816	OK, watch out.  I bought 3 pairs of shoes here on June 5, along with three cheap tops.  It was really noisy and I just signed the credit slip. When I got home, they had charged me $95!!! for a pair of sneakers that was marked $18.99.  Im going in tomorrow to see if they will staigghten it out, but they are very hard core and I think I am out about $60.00 Read the slip!!	0
817	"Chocolate Fountain at Jean Philippe Patisserie at Bellagio is a must see when you are in Las Vegas.  It's a modern day Willy Wonka choco wonder.  This incredible chocolate fountain is rumored to be a million dollar worth.  I took a lot of pictures, because the first time I've seen it 5 yrs ago, I never thought  its got a tag of a million dollar, but I am totally awed by this tall, inticate continuous flow of dark and white chocolate, that I'm so tempted to go underneath it, if it is not enclosed in a glass.\n         Lucky they have crepe in front, fresh to order so I decided to try their \""crepe nutella\"".  I was not disappointed.  It was nicely presented, softly made and with just the perfect amount of that yummy chocolate/hazelnut spread of ferrero's Nutella.  I usually get my crepe at Paris Hotel across the road, but with a show of chocolate fountain while eating your crepe, I would definitely choose Jean Philippe.  I would definitely try their other stuff next time I'm in Vegas."	3
818	We ate here twice while we were staying at Ti. The first time we were here the service was pretty slow on getting us our drink orders, they may have been understaffed though.\n\nThe food was good. One day I had a Ham and Cheese Omelette which was grea! I actually liked that they placed one of those pre-sliced pieces of cheese over the top of the omelette. Some people probably wouldn't like that, but when you've had a night of drinking, something about that 'fake cheese' (as I like to call it) is sooo good :)\n\nSecond time we were there I had the Cobb Salad, omg, fantastic! My husband had a Club Sandwich the first time and it was very good too. The portions they give you are hardy so you're payment won't go to waste. Defiantly give this place a try!\n\n3 stars because there was some food on the ground and we had a sticky table one of the times.	2
819	Paint me with tasty grease* and marinara...\nI'm  f#cking A impressed!\n\nI strolled in the the first time the other day, the little joint was packed, I barely got a parking spot in back. It was around lunch time and as you can imagine between 2 Hippies and this place, it's tough to get in.\n\nAnyway I wasn't sure what to get so the nice folk behind the counter suggested I just try their lunch special.\nHis idea was a stellar one.\n\nThe special was two one topping slices and a can of soda for 4 bucks. That can't really be beat. The slices were huge, two slices basically equaled a quarter pie (felt like about 4 lbs!). Tasty fresh pepperoni, no shortage of mozzarella and good quality mozz I might add as well.\n\nThe little dinning room (and I mean micro) was seatless, all were taken except one 4 top with three suit and tie lawyers noshing at it. They eyed me/sized me with my giant slices and can of Mountain Dew and immediately invited me into their circle. There they offered me a piece of their fine sausage pie. Killer as well. Nice patrons (probably made friendly  by the fine flavorful pie!)\n\nThis is probably the best NYC style slices I have had west of the Mississippi. I shit ya not.\n\nI'll definitely be back and I hope to see you there.\nCiao!\n\n\n\n*pizza is suppose to be greasy!	3
820	I was looking for a professional to help with some skin conditions. The staff said all patients first see their physicians assistant before seeing the doctor, which was fine at first but when I finally got to be seen things went awry.,  First off the PA, Rob is very quick tempered, he got upset at me for asking a question, he cut me off in mid sentence and end up prescribing the wrong medication for me.  They gave me free samples which burned my skin.  Rob the PA did not have the time to settle me down before he carved a hole in my skin, he was very insensitive. I will not go back and see him, but will see the actual medical doctor & will update on the visit with the actual doctor who I am hoping has bedside manor which Rob the PA did not.  He was very unsympathetic and was in a hurry.	1
821	Looks like a great place but we weren't allowed to eat here!  \n\nWas excited to stop in and grab a bite to eat with my 6 year old daughter and a friend of mine. Was there in July on a Wednesday, about 2:30 in the afternoon. Super slow time for any business in az. Us and one other table in the entire place. Sat down and ordered a drink and then were told we needed to finish our drink and leave because no one under 21 was allowed in!!!! ( my friend and I are late 30's, not talking about us....haha)  I would never take my daughter to a club, obviously, but thought this was a restaurant and saw no problem with taking my daughter here for a lunch and some good music. \n\nIf you're looking for a bite to eat and have kids....look elsewhere!!!!! Guess we will be going back to Toby Keith's from now on, lol!!!!	0
822	I was so glad for a new snacking experience to open up in Squirrel Hill.  A Waffles to boot.  The waffles are amazing, very reasonably priced ($2 for a plain waffle and not much more with toppings which has Dozen, the previous occupant beat for value) and mine was still warm when it was handed to me and full of bits of carmelized crunchy sugar goodness.  Thank goodness it's a mile walk from my house.  Any closer and I'd be there every day	4
823	Food and drinks are expensive, and in all honesty not really worth the price.  They're pretty much just regular hot dogs with over the top toppings.  You can count on long lines and hunting for a place to seat. And they've got nothing on my all time favorite hot dogs, Flo's in Cape Neddick, Maine.	2
824	Consistently outstanding and creative food served professionally in a great and even varied ambiance. What more could you ask for? Oh yes, excellent wine list and drinks.	4
825	After reading the amazing reviews, I was so excited to try the pizza at Bottega!  Wow what a let down. The crust is soggy and undercooked (all 6 pizzas ordered) and the woman next to us sent hers back twice before giving up and leaving without eating.  \nThe arancini was disappointing & dry and didn't come with any marinara.  The bacia was bland. \nGreat bright decor for a lunch spot but the pizza is just so bad, who cares?!  And this is not just my personal opinion, the tables on both sides of me were also complaining of soggy pizzas!	0
826	"The Genius Bar is like having a significant other who cheats on you: don't hate the player, hate the game. You want to sock the employees who keep throwing you around like a basketball, saying, \""I'm sorry. I can't help you. But so-and-so over there can.\"" When you finally make it though, they're so nice, you almost feel bad for being pushed around.\n\nI showed up the next day for the Genius Bar appointment I made the day before and even waited 10 min past it because the employees were genius enough to schedule only one dude for the whole bar.\n\nWade turned out to be the man and had me in and out in five minutes. Technically, I had already had my gadgets checked out at the store in Irvine, but he still wanted to follow up just in case. He was supposed to order my charging dock, but he felt bad that the whole process was taking so long for me so he just grabbed one off the shelves and said some other guy who was waiting for a dock could just wait until they shipped another in. \n\nThanks!"	2
827	Being from the East Coast, it is hard to find an authentic New York pizza in AZ. Brooklyn V's is FANTASTIC!!!! Takes me back home.... The crust is fantastic with just the right amount of cheese. We've been here several times but haven't ordered anything other than pizza yet. Based on the other reviews,  trying the Stromboli next. Check this place out, you won't be sorry!	4
828	For a brand new, upscale hotel like the Aria to open a POS club like this amazes me. Did they not see epic-ness going on at the Wynn/Encore? Maze features a bunch of space and a decent crowd but it is very unimpressive and lacks vision and creativity. Very disappointed in the caliber of this place but kudos for the nightclub security for taking care of our table.	1
829	On the positive side the delivery was quick... The egg rolls were burnt, tasted like they had been refried. The vegetable soup good portion for sure...  The cabbage in the soup had black spots all over!!!  I will pay a few extra bucks for anything else next time..  The last time I will eat there..	0
830	If you're looking for some good reviews you'll have to keep looking. \n\nI have been here for a year and a half. Since selling this place and becoming The Huntington Apartments this community's level of quality has significantly dropped. \n\nThe office employees are rude, unorganized, and far from helpful. There is a bug problem that they cannot get fixed in multiple apartments. Their organization is so bad that they can't even keep up with the pest control company's schedule. We have had missed appointments, and not been ready due to miscommunication on their side. \n\nI would not recommend this place to anybody period. We do have community dumpster divers that make their rounds every morning at 6 AM however. \n\nThere are police here non stop because of the amount of crime and disorderly conduct from some of the life forms that live here. Its a complete disaster. No matter how much painting they do around here there is no covering up poor quality living or customer service. If you are apartment hunting, keep hunting and good luck, there are good apartments out there, this just isn't one anymore.	0
831	Too Good\uff01\uff01 the lady herself do all the cooking, but it tastes like home.  The Japche is Better than all the other big Korean restaurant I have ever eaten' h	4
832	The food was mediocre, we had bacon and eggs and a veggie omelette, we will try desert next time.                                        The drinks were very good the service was great, Monique our server did a great job.                                                         The guy in the suit, a manager,was a total maniac he was running around apologizing for everything and saying off the wall things.                                            I would definitely come back for the drinks, they have one bar tender who managed to keep up with my girl and I despite our alcoholic tendencies and all of the drinks were very good.   I have them a 4 because I like to drink and their service was great	3
833	Now this is what I'm talking about!!  Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison.  \n\nStart with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in.  The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes.  No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names.\n\nThis was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good.  I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    \n\nQuick review:\n- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint\n\n- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.  And holy COW was she right.  A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful.\n\n- Falafel.  Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.\n\n- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  \n\nSarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful\n\nAll in all, outstanding.  Next time, shish tahouk and baba ganouj.	3
834	Very impressed. \nI bought a ridiculously cheap groupon for a facial and thought it was worth the risk. And I was right. It was probably one of the best, and I've had many. The ambiance is fine, not quite private or spa like, but definitely acceptable. The skin analysis and tips were great. I'll come back for sure.	4
835	What the fuck?  Did you say this place is All-You-Can-Eat?  Whenever I go to an All-You-Can-Eat place, I always try to get my money's worth.  This time...big mistake.\n\nWhat? Chicken? Get in my bowl biatch!  \nBeef? Get in my bowl biatch!\nOnions?  Do it now!\nCilantro, green onions, cabbage, broccoli, mushrooms, pineapple, zucchini?...all right I'll try some healthy shit.  \nAll these saaauwces!!!  Cause tonight, I'm the saauwce boss!  \nWhatchyou know about stir fry?\n\n4 plates later, I was in the most wicked food coma I've ever experienced.\nAdvice...go easy on the sauce.	2
836	Very good food. Authentic. Spicy as indicated by name. We went there for dinner twice during our short visit to Vegas and we were happy both times.	3
837	I would give this place more of a 3.5 stars.  We had the Hamachi tartare which was above average but wouldn't say it was fantastic, and the Crispy Frog Legs, which I read in a travel book was supposed to be great.  This was actually pretty good.  My boyfriend and I shared the NY Strip steak with Chimichurri, and our friend had the rib eye.  We ordered a medium rare on all our steaks but came out a bit overcooked than I would have liked.  Our service was great.  \n\nOverall I liked the place but I would probably look for other steak places if I'm ever in Vegas again.	2
838	This hotel was by far one of the prettiest for its cost. The restaurants  bathrooms and rooms were killer. Clean rooms and yummy food. Best buffet by far.	4
839	This review is mainly based on the Chihuly Exhibit and the wonderful job Desert Botanical Gardens does to keep this place looking simply fabulous.\n\nBeen here a few times throughout my stay in PHX and each time we come back it gets better and better. The place looks a lot bigger than we remembered and had more paths and special interest to enjoy than last time.\n\nCame with the family and used a Groupon thingamajig. Daughter is a coupon clipper and did a great job on this one. We could not decide whether to see the Chihuly exhibit at night or first thing in the morning. Granddaughter was with us so we decided to go with the early morning adventure and we were not disappointed.\n\nWow is all we can say. What an amazing selection of cactus, desert trees and bushes from all over the world. There are even wildflowers and tons of different critters and birds that make themselves right at home. It was fun watching everyone shooting pictures of just about anything that moved or sweet family photos next to something extravagant or amazing.\n\nThis is always been a great place to take people from out of town or just a great way to get some exercise while enjoying the heavenly works sent from above. We probably walked close to a couple of miles before we were done.\n\nBring your sunscreen, shady hat, some good walking shoes and plenty of liquids to drink. The dessert can take the life right out of you if you are not careful. So be cool and stay hydrated and rest in the shade when you get a chance. MOST EXCELLENT!\n\n4.75 STARS	4
840	Located in Red Rock Casino & Hotel. Decent food. Obviously, if you are in the hotel, convenient location and open 24hrs.	2
841	This place is shit the workers lie about transfer fees and when they find out you dont have an AR or Glock they are dicks.	0
842	In a word...yuk. Ordered takeout. If you like frozen pizza taste with a cardboard crust and canned sauce this is your place. Maybe kids would like it, but not adults who have ever eaten a good pizza.	1
843	"Ramen... another food that is new to my palette and is as old as time to my wife's. This review is a summation of what took me a solid week to get out of my wife who is too nice to give something negative without finding the smallest compliment go with it, but who's Japanese pride eventually boils to the surface.\n\nFirst, the good!\nLocation: Easy to get to off the 215 and a small drive from the 15.\nStaff: Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and took the time to explain what was going on and made sure we had all the condiments we needed. Whenever she saw I water getting low she was quick with a refill.\nAtmosphere: Urban chic, but laid back enough to unwind. The modern upbeat Jazz music was a nice change from the norm.\n\nThe bad:\nNow, I know there is always a battle between those who hold authenticity close to their hearts and those who give leeway due to the fact that this is Las Vegas not Japan.\n\nThe wife and I ordered the Tonkatsu, I took mine regular while the wife combo'd it with gyoza and hanjuku egg. The wife's first sip of the broth was followed by a \""that's not right\"" look, but being the cheerful person she is said it tasted good. Upon further hammering by me she said \""The broth is not as 'deep' as it should be.\"" When I kept on asking how she stated \""There isn't that much flavor, there should be more flavor\"" and that she thought she was eating miso sesame ramen, not tonkotsu. She was also put off by the sake like after taste of the hanjuku egg, void of the umami flavor she was expecting.\n\nShe summed it up by saying that she would never bring in a person from Kyushu, where tonkatsu ramen is there pride. When I asked if she would bring in another Japanese person at all she answered with a quick 'no.'\n\nWhat really highlighted how off their broth was when we made the instant tonkotsu she had in the cupboard only a few days later. After tasting that I understood how disappointed my wife was.\n\nSo, was it good soup? Yes.\nWas it proper ramen? No, no, no."	1
844	Terrible. Bad employee attitudes and lack of team work. The poppyseed muffin was so hard it crumbled into crunchy pieces. Wasted money. Went to Starbucks for lemon pound cake. ..yummm	1
845	Friends of mine wanted to go here to celebrate some birthdays. It was cute - they gave the birthday ladies each a mug with a balloon tied to it, and they could go up to a special place at the bar to get free drinks all night. The free drinks were draught beers and a few basic mixed drinks, I think. It's very kitschy and this is the official birthday place. I ordered a burger, and it was perfectly good. Nothing to write home about, and it's good for groups. We came on a weeknight so I can't say anything about crowdedness. Seems like it's most fun if you're the one celebrating your birthday :) And free drinks all night - you can't complain about that!	2
846	"They lost a customer in me!!!\nI took a coupon there that I received in the Valpak envelope that gets delivered to your home and they would not honor it. The cashier said it was a mis- print and when I asked him what does that mean does it mean you are not honoring your own coupon he plainly said \"" Yes we don't print them and it was not our mistake.\"" \nNow I am pretty sure someone at that company had to approve  the ad before it went to print and I am sure that no one thinks that they have a printing machine in their back office. I think unless you post a retraction up in the store or on the door that they should have honored the discount which worked out to be about $4. Instead the lost a lot more, a customer.  I will never waste my time going there again. Shame on them."	0
847	MY FAVORITE Happy Hour (food) Menu!!  The calamari, the bbq chicken pizza, the sushi rolls, and the sliders are the best choices!  The Happy Hour prices are great too!  Sometimes it does get pretty noisy, but it's a fun place to go to watch a game and hang out with friends.  To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the happy hour drink menu... Their cosmos make me sick, they're far too sweet, the wine doesn't ever seem like that good of a deal, nor do the saki bombs.  But the food is great!!!	3
848	"OK, I agree that the food is great, but for the price and the reviews, I was expecting a bit better interior design.  The walls are painted dark gray, and there are exposed wires & speakers.  The \""leather chairs\"" are basically just club chairs, which are OK, but not exceptional.  I can get better atmosphere in a Houstons.   I felt like I was in a \""design on a dime\"" renovation that are supposed to look nice, but still pretty cheap.\n\nI was disappointed in the glassware as well - the water glasses were these clunky amber glasses that you can find in a Sizzler.  The tables are very close together, and I was bothered by the fact that I had to bump up into someone else just to get into my seat.    Seriously, I could spruce this place with a quick trip to Target.   \n\nMaybe my mistake is that I had high aspirations for Montreal cuisine having been to Toque (which blew my mind) and several other fantastic restaurants in the area.\n\nAs for the food - it was not over the top.  It definitely was excellent, well prepared, and relatively creative.    We did the tasting menu, and were served 4 courses.  The scallops were fantastic.  The risotto was perfectly cooked, and the boar was excellent.  I just didn't feel that it got the \""over the top\"" rating that had been recommended.\n\nI suggest that the owners remove a table or two, getting a \""real\"" interior decorator, changing out the cheap glassware for glassware that goes with the wine and food, and paying attention to the details.  It's the little things that matter, and although they came through on the execution of the food, they lacked sufficient creativity, and skimped on the atmosphere.  \n\nFor almost $300, I expect top food, top service, and DETAILS.  Get the details right, and you get another star.  Wow me and you get another."	2
849	I still hate this place but am cursed as my husband loves it..I tried to hide the fact they opened one in Matthews but can't ooooh noooooooo I	1
850	"Definitely a little corny but it was a lot of fun! You have to remember it's not exactly like the TV version. My friends and I had a lot of fun even though we didn't get called up. The famous showcase round was by far the most ridiculous \""set up\"" ever. \nA cruise to Mexico\nA trip to Hawaii\n100 shares in stocks\n2012 Nissan.....the 1st person said $29,675, 2nd person said $33,000\n\nwait for it..............$14,000!!!! come on!! That's not even fair! Of course everyone would over bid if they value all those items for that price!"	3
851	Big store with organized racks of clothing, good book section, and lots of choices to make. If you make a donation, you will get a coupon for 20% off your purchase over $10.00. Since I am always going through my closet, I usually will have a bag to donate. On mondays, there is a color tag that is chosen and is 50% off. On holidays, everything in the store is 50% off- expect a long line. Boutique, cashiers, donation bin, & dressing rooms are in front. Books (and other media), house wares, womens clothing in the middle of the store. Men's clothing, furniture, bags, and shoes are in back. I usually find books (nothing over $2.99), clothing and other items like Partylite candles and accessories. I found a Tignello leather bag in near mint condition here. The boutique bag/jewelry section is over-inflated (priced $120 and up)- you can go to the outlet store and get a new designer bag for way less than that. Still, I'd rather go here than Goodwill (less organized, higher priced).	3
852	Great selection. Sushi. Hibachi.  Will make anything you want.	3
853	Hell hath no fury more than a Sunday afternoon at McCarran International Airport.\n\nWhy you ask? How about trying to fight for a flight home to LA? How about just trying to get to your gate when you are lost?\n\nIt's just crowded. The security lines are understaffed. Your gate basically is in Baker, California. You have to take a tram to get to most of them. The gates that don't have the tram, well, if you need to switch flights, it'll probably be in another gate area, MILES AWAY.\n\nSure, there's the 70 percent payouts on the slot machines that beckon your dollars, the taxi lines that move faster than Disneyland, and cab rides that are 9 dollars to the airport but 25 dollars from it, the only decent food is at the Ruby's, and the luggage area larger than Philadelphia, PA.\n\nThursdays and Sundays are absolute hell, and I've been in there for a layover at midnight on a Friday, and it was still crowded. Go figure.	2
854	The last time my friends and I stayed in Vegas, we ended up at Treasure Island because we got a really good deal.  When we checked in, we noticed there was a Pho Restaurant and thought it was so random.  We scoffed at the patrons dining inside who had paid the exorbitant prices to eat Vietnamese food we were certain was mediocre at best. Little did we know we'd be there the following afternoon as well as the next slurping up the noodle soup to cure our pounding heads from our mad hangovers.\n\nBottom line: Prices are steep but it is Vegas after all and it's definitely not the best Pho I've ever had but if you happen to be staying at Treasure Island, check this place out because nothing cures a hangover better than some noodle soup.	2
855	Another Sprinkler repair Co. that did not show. I finally called Sprinkler Man he was right on time and fixed it fast	0
856	Called to make an appointment. Was asked what insurance I have and told her I didn't have insurance. She said Dr. Venkat wasn't currently taking cash patients. Wtf! Seems kinda rude.	0
857	We have ordered from Barro's before and had good expereince. Ordered wings (extra crispy) and Barros special pizza.  Showed up 45 minutes.  Pizza was not cooked through and hubby had to put wings on the grill -I don't like it when I pay top dollar to eat out and they can't get it right..	1
858	I love shanghai-nese food since I am shanghai-nese.  The staff was helpful in ordering stuff.  Food was quite good so no complaints.  I would come back when I am in town.	3
859	As a grocery store....it's ok. What really surprised me is when I went to their meat department looking for knockwurst. The guy in the meat department didn't even know what that was and referred me to Harris Teeter. WTF?????	1
860	I love frozen yogurt. But my logic is that if you are getting FroYo, you are gonna want a more refreshing and fruity flavor. If not, you want Ice cream. Every time I have been in here they have had one fruit flavor and it was always something I am allergic to or dislike. They never even had original tart, which I thought all places had.\nThey do however have a pretty nice selection of toppings.\nThe place is pretty clean, the service is alright, and the price is the same as most frozen yogurt places per oz.	1
861	The food here is great, but the service is TERRIBLE.  I have been there twice, and the first time I figured the poor and rude service was a fluke so I didn't write a review.  Well, we gave it another try and again...TERRIBLE service.  The waiter acted like we were bothering him, and walked away before we even finished talking.  We waited 15 minutes for our table, which I wouldn't have minded, but the hostess said they had a table almost ready for us when we walked in.  It took forever to get our bill (hand scratched on a notepad), and we were overcharged for our drinks.  Happy hour prices are awesome and I really do like the food, but because of the poor/lazy/rude attitudes of the wait staff I will not be coming back.  The bus boys were very on top of things, but without a better trained wait staff I don't see why people would come back.  Check out Firefly on the same block for even better food and fantastic service :)	0
862	I had heard abt there so called BLIZZARD but was very disappointed with the taste or   Flavor or I would say was that an nice cream	0
863	Food took way too long.	0
864	My grandma was in the ICU for three weeks before she passed away and let me tell you that the nurses and chaplains here were so awesome! They knew we were going through a hard time and let us stay all the time and even accommodated my entire family when we were all in my grandma's room with her. The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because sometimes the doctors can be prima donna's. They are entitled to be that way sometimes considering all the experience and school they have but still. We had an awesome nurse who was very helpful and went out of her way to get us answers. One of the doctors didn't like that so they had her moved do a different area! Overall though, we had a good experience here.	3
865	Sprawling, private, outdoor dining - check. Beer, wine, and cocktail menu spanning 10+ pages - check. Delicious, complex, and diverse food - check.  There are many reasons to love House of Tricks, these are just a few.  Others include excellent service, a prime location in the heart of Tempe, and a beautiful outdoor bar.  The restaurant is truly unique, and a welcome break from the typical tan, stucco box restaurants around Phoenix.  I've been eating here for years and keep coming back to sample new things on the menu.  My latest visit introduced me to the short ribs and they were rich, moist, just perfect.  For starters, we tried the cheese platter, the mussels, and the wild boar... all were excellent.  Dessert was also good, a salted caramel gelato.  Expect to pay up for all this greatness, but it is worth it.  It's a great spot for a romantic date night, or a quiet business dinner in a unique setting.  I'll be back, soon!	4
866	This place did an amazing job in helping me to recover from Friday night on the Strip.\nHonestly I was surprised by how good the food was! Service was really nice and prompt. And out of nowhere I had the best Mechilada ever....my hangover was happy @_@\n\nGo for the Egg Benedict and you will not regret it. Perfect place to visit before heading out to explore the strip or going to the pool summer time...!	4
867	We've been by this place a number of times since we live right by it and we finally decided to try it.  The family was starving and I was in the mood to try something new.  I ordered some chicken and beef tacos, chicken and beef tostadas, a cheese quesadilla, some chips/salsa, and flan to go.  It didn't take too long for the order.  It was probably in the 5-10 minute range.  \n\nI took it all home and placed it on the table for everyone to dig in.  We pulled out the tacos and tostadas.  The meat was great!  Everyone agreed that the tacos were better than the tostadas.  The tostadas seemed to be a little on the crispy side.  The kids tore through the quesadilla so I'm assuming it was pretty good.  The chips and salsa were very good.  \n\nThey also give you a salsa bar to select different kinds of salsa which is very nice.  We sampled the different salsas and found them all to be very tasty.  \n\nWe all finished and it was time for dessert...the flan.  Wait, all the bags were open...where was the flan???  Well $&%@!!!!  They didn't give us the flan but they were nice enough to charge us for it.  I have to admit it was one of the pictures I saw here on yelp and it looked so good.  I was really looking forward to trying it.  I thought about going back and the kids wanted me to go back but it was late on a Monday night and I just wasn't feeling like going to argue for flan.  \n\nI've been debating between giving this place a 3 or a 4.  I really liked the meat but I'm really pissed about the flan.  I finally decided to go ahead and give it a 4.  I did like the flavor of the meat and I will probably return for more tacos.  If you get takeout I would highly suggest giving your bag a couple of extra checks to make sure you aren't missing any items or you risk getting home and being disappointed.	3
868	This used to be the best mall in the area.  Then along came Arizona Mills, Chandler Fashion Center, and Tempe Marketplace.  Those three places, in my opinion, seems to have taken at least those patrons who live in Chandler, Tempe and Gilbert.\n\nThere are still good stores here, including many of the same stores you will find at the other malls.  We have found that Fiesta is now much less busy and crowded than it used to be.  This is particularly nice during Christmas season/sales.\n\nAnd they have an area of covered parking which the other malls don't.  Very nice in summer.	2
869	This outlet SUCKS.  The only store worth visiting is the Nike Outlet.  That's it.  Don't waste your time here.	0
870	Very friendly service and nice atmosphere. They also allowed me to order the kid's bean & cheese burrito, which was only $4 and very large! It was also very good. Hopefully I will be able to return in the future to try more of the menu.	3
871	I've had two experiences with this store - the first was bad, the second was adequate.  I went in to the ATT store about 2 weeks ago to upgrade to the Iphone 4 and join a family plan with a friend.  The sales associate at the time seemed to know what he was doing and set it all up - told us it would take up to 3 days to get the plan together and that he would call us both when it was done.  A week later and no phone call, I went back to the store and talked with another associate who informed me that nothing was done since my first visit and in fact nothing needed to be done, that I could have an Iphone in 20 minutes and sure enough 20 minutes later the plans were set and the numbers were together on a family plan.  Overall the experience wasn't a good one, in that I had to wait an extra week for nothing, and was told misinformation from the start (plus the wait times were an hour one time I stopped in).  I'd suggest another store to upgrade or change plans.	1
872	Dropped by here to watch This is The End.  The theater was huge, the screen was very clear and the seating was so comfortable.  I will definitely return here to watch a movie again if in the area.  Also, this place has bowling, pool and eateries.  Give this place a try if in the area.	4
873	2/5 for great people working there, and the friendly vibe you get just walking in the door. BAM, smells like a pickling factory but do not fear, the bar area looks fun. Our experience was bad however-- the noodles in our ramen were cooked Al Dente, and you know what that means once an amalgam of them begins to expand in your stomach. They definitely weren't cooked all the way, so thus, I felt like I was going to LITERALLY lose my food after I finished a relatively small bowl. Yeah, I'm a small person, but you know, I can still eat! I just felt so sick afterwards.\n\nThe spinach- strange & refreshing.\nThe carrots- lovely.\nThe pork- cold, but good.\nThe nori- you know, your standard nori.\nThe broth- yeah, a little salty, but good. We tried the Pai Ton, the tonkotsu broth without the Pork ordeal.\n\n\nBut the noodles! They made me so sick, and I really want to love this place because their ramen is so diverse. After the meal, one of the friendly staff members made us some little non-alcoholic shots, so like I said-- SUPER NICE people! I just can't handle their style of food, it doesn't agree with me at all. If you're sensitive like me, try Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe-- they'll be a more classic and authentic option for you. \nCheers!	1
874	Every meal I have here is good.  I love the pancakes and breakfast burrito.  The staff is very nice and helpful (love Donna Jo), the service is great and the price is right.  :)	4
875	Friendly staff and quick service but, unfortunately they couldn't make up for the unappetizing dining room and BLAND food.  I'll  be shopping around for another Chinese place.	1
876	$4 steak and eggs special during midnight graveyard hours. Its not on the menu but you can ask the waitress about it and they will tell you about it. NOT bad for the portion they give you, it comes with hash browns and toast as well. What a deal! I only go here for their steak and eggs specials after a long night of clubbing and partying. Inside of the Tuscany suite at Marilyn cafe.	3
877	"Just a update that this one is fairly consistent and I've had few issues over the years. Even on a \""off\"" day it's never bad, just maybe a tad dry/salty/greasier than I like. \n\nI mostly order the same things when I go here. I get the California burrito (carne asada, pico, cheese, potatoes), carnitas burrito, super nachos, breakfast burrito, chicken taquitos or chorizo plate. I have delved off before, but I feel these are the better things to order so I stick with it.  The only thing I avoid though is shredded chicken here - I'm not a fan of it shredded and then sitting in a sort've sauce. I prefer grilled and diced style chicken at other places. \n\nI always have found it amusing that somehow this is the unofficial hangout for teens who just got their cars. I guess there's not much up here they're allowed late-ish. \n\n24 hours, fairly decent fast food, inside the Fabulous Freddys. Don't be afraid of gas station food, this one isn't seedy or anything. It's rather clean and big, with seating inside. No, it's not like my favorite hole in the walls where they don't speak English, but don't turn your nose at this chain.\n\n It's decent late night food and is part of our rotation when we don't want to cook. I come at a certain time at night every night and usually on days we work. I don't know if that makes a difference as it seems its the same cook, but whoever is working after 10pm has been decent."	3
878	Really, really slow. I know this isn't McDonalds, but 30 min. to get half our order and another 20 to get the rest? This was 9:30 am and there were only 6 other people in there the entire 1:15 hours we were there. Really cute place, small portions at great prices; but it just doesn't matter when they are so slow. Seriously, the woman behind the counter was even moving slow, no sense that people might be coming to her food establishment because they are hungry. And - the reason for 1 star- I could see her work because I was facing the counter, she was handling all the food with her bare hands. Picking up waffles, slicing strawberries, AND taking cash, answering the business phone, texting on her cell phone, never putting on gloves to handle food AND never washed her hands. Disgusting, I won't be back.	0
879	While the staff was friendly, my take out order was wrong--only discovered after I was home. The fries were hot, but so soggy they were almost inedible. Not what I expected from a business affiliated with Eat n' Park.	1
880	Best H & M I have ever shopped at. The one at home in Seattle is tiny to me, and this one had three levels, with a bathroom on the third floor (because you're a tourist and you are drunk shopping, naturally). Great selection of clothing and tons of accessories. I feel like my experience with H & M is that most sizes are gone and things are picked through. Not the case here. There were many sizes and varieties of things in all sorts of colors. I was fortunate enough to go in the fall and living in Seattle I got to pick up a lot of warm weather accessories that I am not sure many of the Vegas locals were quite ready to buy yet. I  got a huge bag for $100. Only annoyance here was that the music is way too loud and it stresses me out, but I was so consumed with finding cute clothes that I ignored it for the most part.	4
881	This sucks. I am still sitting inside Villa Pizza at a dirty table waiting for my chicken wings and fries. It has now been over 40 minutes that I've been waiting and no food in sight. Plus this place is freezing.  It is 46 degrees outside and not much warmer inside, and I am sitting as far as possible from the front door. This is my first horrible restaurant experience and I'm glad I have my iPhone to draft this review. \n\nNever again!	0
882	This is price based alone.  The quality of the cleaning was good but no different than a regular dry cleaners.  I had no idea I would be paying $41 to have a pair of slacks and one mans dress shirt cleaned.  Shame on me for not asking ahead of time but in no way did I think it would ever be that pricey.  These were not designer pants so I wonder why the counter girl didnt alert me and wonder why Id be paying so much these to be normally cleaned.  I would go back if I had a fancy item because they do have attention to detail but never again for my normal dy cleaning	2
883	eh.\n\nfirst of all, this place had been hyped up to me by a couple of people(hubby included) for several days. add that to the fact that parking on Mill's a b*tch, and you will realize why this was such a let-down for me.\n\nnow, we'll begin with the pros:\n*free peanuts while you wait\n*delicious cajun fries\n*malt vinegar\n\n...that's about it.\n\nthe burger was kind of dry and, I suspect, would have been about as good as, say, McDonalds, had I not added my plethora of toppings. the service took forever(and it was nearly empty in there), and their sh*t is EXPENSIVE.\n\nLenny's, in Glendale, has them beat. hands down.	1
884	Fantastic food, eat there frequently, very good service, my wife and I enjoy Soyo evdrytime we go	4
885	"As far as I could tell, unless using the amenities, there is nothing special about Hyatt Place. It did not stand out from the La Quintas and Holiday Inns i've been to in the past.\n\nMy stay was nice enough, but nothing made it a cut above the others, it was just a place to put my bag during the day and lay my head at night. My room consisted of a king sized bed, sofa sleeper, mini fridge, awkward bathroom, and a TV that went unused. The \""amenities\"" were odd. For ten dollars extra (daily) you could park your car. The pool was tiny. The bar was limited, but the bartender tried her best to make what I wanted. Supposedly there was a work out room, but I didn't see it. \n\nThe downstairs/common areas were spacious and offered plenty of room for guests to mingle.\n\nSeveral things caught me off guard - the cost for three nights (Wed/Thurs/Fri) came out to over $700, creaky elevators were slow to start, hard toilet paper, strange hair in the bathroom/shower, and unidentifiable rust colored stains on the white quilt. \n\nWhoever laid out the rooms had strange ideas as to what people want, particularly with regards to the bathroom: the sink was outside of the bathroom, and the towel rack was inside the shower. The singular light in the bathroom took about twenty minutes to get to full brightness, and sitting on the toilet and opening / closing the door was totally not an option and it needed to be. Sitting on the toilet with the door closed meant being pressed up against the door.\n\nThe best features about the room/hotel - a functioning A/C, and the huge walk-in/fun-sized shower. The bed was comfy enough after a sixteen or seventeen hour day spent in meetings and walking around. And the staff was pleasant and happy to assist guests with their needs. Shuttle services were offered for free to anywhere within two miles of the hotel, and a pretty decent breakfast spread was available each morning.\n\nFrom what I saw of guests, this isn't a place where one has to worry about being disturbed by children at all hours."	2
886	Good food, but plan on eating a hot dog later. It was very expensive for the portion size.  However, everything tasted amazing!  We had 2 to 3 tapas per person and each tapa had maybe 3 to 4 bites each and cost between nine and $12.   The cocktails were some of the best we had on our trip.   If you are in the mood to spend $20 on a gin and tonic I highly recommend their signature one.  This is definitely a splurge meal and I would recommend the restaurant just be prepared that the portions are a little bit on the small side.	3
887	Decor - 5 star\nGel Nail Polish selection - 5 star\nGlitter & Nail Art:  - 5 star\nPrice - 3 star\nOverall Nail Experience: 3 Star\n\nPros: Great nail color, art & glitter selections, atmosphere & salon are chic and stylish\nCons: touch overpriced as they charge you for every little extra where many of those are included elsewhere. Nail polish didn't stay on full 2 weeks; chipped after about a week. \n\nWill still come back but won't expect 5 stars.	3
888	The pizza is decent. Middle of the road, New York style. Not the issue. \n\nThe Managers have horrible costumer service skills. And will curse You out on the phone and tell You to come get your pizza yourself. \n\nI ordered a pizza, total was eight or nine dollars. First question I was asked was if it was for delivery. I said yes, then gave my address. Two hours later, I almost forgot entirely, I call and ask about my\nPizza. I first asked if the order went through, I'm told it did, then I asked why it didn't get delivered, I was handed over to the GM, by this point I'm antsy, I ask who took my order and where is my pizza. The GM tells me the assistant manager took my order, and then when I asked why it didn't get delivered he cursed at me and told me to come pick it up myself and that I owed him money for the pizza and he wasn't remaking it. I hang up. Call back and ask what the minimum delivery order is and the girl tells me 10 dollars. I then asked if the assistant manager usually answers the phone, she said no. \n\nI wonder who messed this up. Sounds like the GM never trained the Assistant manager....	1
889	"We were in for a treat.Piero was there and he did the honors!!!The friend who invited\nme has known Piero ever since he came to LasVegas. I had veal scalipini, tossed salad.,and potates lyonnise(Sp). Ugo had Orange roughy, schrimp scampi, Caesars salad. We split a plate of fried ocra, complements of Don Pierio.It makes a great\nappetizer. Our food was exceptional and done to a turn. Signore Piero made the rounds and presented himself to each table. As of this writing, Piero is the ambience. \nChloe needs to invest in some chianti bottles, waiters with old school white /black\nuniforms, and a mustache pete stuck in the corner with  a red checkered bib( hung\nfrom his collar) to keep Piero's dyno  veal parmesan from stainin' duh corbat.\nI don't remember the pricing. Prices were printed on the menu. So how bad\ncan they be? I'm going back regardless of pricing.  I will say finding a SPECTACULAR Italian ristorante like this,sandwiched between a \""craft\"" store and Art's Bail Bonds,\nis the kind of juxtaposition I can live with. Molto beni."	4
890	This place in general is a little too cheesy for me.  They offer mediocre seafood with over the top waitstaff.  The waitstaff remind me of the movie Office Space where they try to be overly excited that you are there.  It is almost like you are buying a used car.   \n\nI will start with the food.  It is very messy and drizzled in butter.  Don't wear any good clothes or risk having butter splotches all over.  The food itself is just ok.  Nothing to write home about.  \n\nThe on-tap beer selection is less than desired.  If you like mass produced beers then you are in luck.  \n\nI would say save your money go to a locally owned restaurant where you won't be subjected to all of the cheesiness.	1
891	"If you're a guy going to Vegas and thinking about getting into XS on girls night be prepared to wait at least 2 hours in the general admission line! We went over the weekend when Zedd was suppose to be playing but he canceled last minute due to \""illness\"". XS offered to issue refunds but unfortunately i guess only to those people that didn't go in. Sucks for the rest of us eh? \n\nAnyhow the if you're not baller enough to drop a couple grand on table service and not on the guest list you'll need to wait through the Disneyland style queue. But hey if you also wanna be suckered by the bouncers or still wanna be baller you can pay off the bouncer to get into the \""express line\"". That could cost you anywhere from $20-100 though. But hey this is Vegas money can buy anything right? \n\nThe venue itself is pretty spectacular once you get in! It features a huge pool which yes people do jump into fully dressed or in there undies. Although be prepared to get kicked out if you get out of the pool soaking wet. Also be aware of them douches splashing everyone on the sides. Yes there are fights that break out randomly as we witnessed. \n\nThe drinks are pretty standard and definitely pricey. But again this is Vegas so you gotta pay to play right! Cmon $5 for regular coke and $10 for a bottle of water too for those DD's! Cocktails and beers range from $10-20 as well. But hey if you got girls in your group and its ladies night don't forget to get them free drink vouchers! \n\nThe music is a pretty much a mix of EDM but depends on the DJ spinning that night. Sadly we didn't get to see Zedd so we had some no name guy playing all night. The dance floor does get packed and watchout for them bouncers that will literally football style push everyone out of the way to make room for staff or the baller VIP table guests to get through. Yeah people be getting squished in the middle but oh wells its  Vegas right! \n\nIf you're coming to see a specific artist play for the night definitely check XS's twitter or Facebook before coming! Otherwise go hit up Marquee or somewhere else!"	2
892	I've lived in Tempe for over thirteen years and have been ordering pizzas from this location since moving to Tempe from Ahwatukee. I've never had a bad pizza from the Ahwatukee location (Lived there 6 months.) nor the Tempe location. On average we order Rosati's pizza from this location at least every 3 weeks or so. We save the coupons from the boxes so we've had a lot of pizzas for half off over the 13 years of being a customer of the Tempe location. Our favorite pizza has been the Gonzo (Pepperoni, spinach, green olives.), we are currently ordering double pepperoni, double spinach, onions and black olives. Same quality for over 13 years. And no I have not received any compensation for this review - just wanted to submit an honest review.	4
893	"The coffee isn't good and they don't seem to care. If you're a local, I get that it's the only game in town but this place isn't worth traveling for. \n\nI really wanted to like tazza d'oro. I've been several times, hoping that my bad experiences were isolated incidences. I drink espresso. I know what it should taste like and what it looks like when the person making it gives a damn. I have no complaints about paying $3.00 for an espresso but if it isn't right and I let you know you should probably try again. \n\nThe last time I went in, both baristas admitted they hadn't tried/pulled the espresso I ordered. The gentlemen working there, who was very nice, pulled my shot. I tried it and it was very sour. I let the girl standing directly in front of me know that I didn't think it was pulling correctly and her response was an unenthused look and the comment \""ya well we just got it\"". Silly me to have expected that you also want the espresso you \""just got\"" to taste good...\n\nThis place clearly isn't going anywhere in the near future. It's a favorite with locals who like to hangout there. It's just a shame that they seem to have all of the equipment and even the beans to make at least a decent shot and they don't seem to care about actually pulling it off."	0
894	Highly recommend. Had them out to look at a couple of our Viking appliances before we host a big Thanksgiving dinner next week. Justin was quick, professional and knowledgable. He worked us into his schedule and even gave me a warning call on his way so our barking dogs wouldn't wake up my napping toddler! He was able to figure out the problem on our range and also fixed our temperamental ice dispenser. His tools were neat and organized; he wore a professional uniform with his name embroidered- I felt very comfortable with him in my home. He also gave me some tips on basic maintenance I should do to keep my appliances working well! We are also having him look at a gas dryer at our rental property as well.	4
895	Have been to Joe's a number of times and enjoyed their food.  We have had terrible service every time, though.  It's worth going because the food is good and the atmosphere is fun.  Just be patient, and your night will be fine.	2
896	We came during rush hour...3pm on Christmas day. People were everywhere and it was easy to see that they were understaffed (poor waitress was running everywhere). We were seated and ordered fairly quickly as well. We waited 15 minutes to be seated....then an additional 45 minutes for our food. By the time we got our order, the restaurant was pretty much cleared out! Granted, everyone who was seated around our time also had to wait, but pho should be quick! Anyway, this is what we ordered:\n\nPho tai: The bf did not like the beef...said it was very chewy.\n\nPho (well done steak, brisket, tendon, tripe): I liked my dish. Meat was soft, tendon aplenty, and tripe was good too. The noodles were slightly undercooked though.\n\nEgg rolls: Skinny and EXTREMELY oily. There was a puddle of oil after we were done. Flavor was good though.\n\nOverall, we all agreed that our broth was a bit too bland and the noodles too hard. I think they ran out of ingredients and had to rush everything, hence the low quality of our meal. I will take into account that I am probably spoiled from living in the OC and LA area where pho is everywhere, but for the rating Kinh Do has, it should have been better. Honestly, I'm not sure if I will go here again when there are so many up and coming pho places in Vegas, but we'll see.	1
897	As a Chicago girl, I know a thing or two about pizza.  While Roman Candle does some things well, I had a few issues.\n\nFirst, the delivery was fast, free and the delivery guy was super nice and professional.  The pizza crust was a good balance between ultra thin crust and deep dish.  They don't go too crazy on the toppings and the menu gives tons of options for specialty pizzas.\n\nHowever... the pizzas arrived, how shall I say... less than hot?  Kinda luke warm.  And just so you know, when you microwave wood fired pizzas, they lose their magic.  Also, Roman Candle is on the pricey side.  $31 (plus tip!) for two medium pizzas seemed a bit excessive.\n\nPerhaps next time I'm in the area I'll try dining in.	2
898	Brought my car in for an oil change because I had a coupon. Two weeks later I noticed oil stains in my garage where I park. I brought it back to my regular mechanic and he said that the Firestone mechanic that worked on it left the washer out when they put the oil tank plug back in and it was leaking.	0
899	What a surprise! Came here from a recommendation by a friend, and it lived up to it's rep. It's got a nice, trendy, modern sort of atmosphere, and combined with tasty Thai fusion (I don't know if I'd call it 100% traditional) - it's a definite hit!  We'll be back again	4
900	"It was great that we got Comped tickets for the Friday night Seafood special...but one word to describe it \""Horrible\"" the hot crab legs were mushy and old looking, the seafood stew was mostly sauce with some type of mystery meat floating around, the beets, green beans, mashed potato,etc etc were all canned food type quality, the shrimp and mussel station was nothing more than cooking it it in a cup of butter and some spices.  Save your $dollars and buy a burger at the snack bar next to \nthe sports book."	0
901	"Review by a Restaurant Consultant\n\nWhen Guy Fieri highlights your restaurant on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives, you know that it's got to be an interesting place.  I've tried several restaurants in Southern California and Las Vegas that he's reviewed.  When Guy went to Yayo's near UNLV, I knew we had to try it.\n\nYayo's location is in a small shopping center directly across from the university.  Usually, with in-line restaurants, you don't expect too much.  I was pleasantly surprised when we visited the restaurant.  The ambiance is really interesting, with almost \""Old Mexico\"" themed tables and lighting.  This theme is carried on outside on the patio as well.  \n\nWith restaurants, the food must impress.  Boy, Yayo's really hit a home run with their food.  Their portions are more than sufficient, especially when you realize what a value their food really is.  They have the best soft tacos in town!  If you get their student special, you probably won't be able to finish the plate.\n\nThe other aspect of Yayo's that's impressive is their service.  Jonathan greets you nicely as you enter, assisting you with your menu selections.  His laid-back attitude is perfect for Yayo's.  Their menu is quite large, so the extra help with items is always appreciated.\n\nYayo's is our go-to Mexican quick service restaurant in Las Vegas.  As long as you understand that it's not fine dining, you'll be fine.  The next time you're in town, drop by Yayo's and you will be pleasantly surprised."	4
902	"This place has been recently renovated (as of September 2009) to include a Wal-Mart grocery store. I don't think it qualifies as a \""Supercenter\"" because it lacks a McDonald's and a bank and a vision department and all that. But I was pleased to be able to have an alternative for grocery shopping in the neighborhood.\n\nAfter some growing pains experienced in their inventory, they finally started carrying the Yakult probiotic beverage in their dairy section. I drink this stuff daily to stay regular (become friends with your intestinal flora, I say), and have been miffed to find that it sells for $3 a six-pack. But this Wal-Mart carries the cheap, Mexican alternative Bio Salud for 88 cents a six pack!\n\nBut allow me to climb down from my gastrointestinal soapbox... The groceries at this Wal-Mart are not always the best quality (e.g. the bacon I purchased was quite fatty, and the shredded Parmesan was less flavorful than most), but you can find some bargains here. And then there's always the rest of the store to explore for those random items you never knew you needed."	2
903	We've been twice in the past couple years and enjoyed both performances (Simon Boccanegra and Madame Butterfly) immensely. Unfortunately, by the time we fly in and find a hotel (even at Jerry's) we only feel like we can afford the cheap seats. The chairs are a little narrow up there in opera glass country. Might have to open the wallet a little next time. Check if there is a pre-show lecture - worth the time and you might get closer parking in the garage. Parking is a good deal for AZ.	3
904	The wait is ridiculous! And compared to the others in town this one STINKS. And would NOT honor the VIP Free sandwich card. NO-ONE in the place looked happy. Customers were stating this is my last time here too. SAD SAD, cause they are usually good. Sahara store is worth the trip! ALWAYS GOOD THERE!	0
905	service is ok.\nfood is ok...actually really bland and plain. I had the blackened salmon and my parents had the roasted turkey breast.\nchamomile tea is the best.\n\ngood luck.	1
906	WAY OVERPRICED!!!  This is a great place for first timers but i doubt they will be getting frequent customers returning.  Their menu is just too expensive.	0
907	"I will never go there again. I went there for the first time yesterday evening and ordered \""The Natural.\"" I got home opened it and the bun was twice the size if the \""natural\"" burger. Not only was it small and insignificant, but dryer than piece of cardboard. Anyways the reason I really wrote this review is because this morning I also woke up with severe stomach pain and diarrhea. Not fun while I get ready for work. Carls Jr has more high quality burgers."	0
908	Really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Has a lot of character, and unlike most venues with the older/rustic vibe, it was also very clean. The rooms were quiet and you could not hear any noise from outside or from other rooms -- a real rarity downtown. It was an excellent location as it was walking distance from almost all of the spots we wanted to visit.  The service was friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.	3
909	Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):\n8 Food\n8 Service\n8 Atmosphere\n7 Value	2
910	Murphy's greatest attribute is its location. The downtown Chandler area has so much potential and this is a good start. Murphy's is located in a nice plaza near the heart of the city. It's an Irish pub because we don't have enough of these in the Valley, right? \n\nIt's in a narrow suite but the bar runs almost the full length of the place. It's not very large so it gets crowded fast. The weird thing is that it dies down after 11pm. I don't know why, the people just leave. Perhaps they know something I don't. But when there are people it a mix of late 20's to young 40's crowd.\n\nThey have a lot of beers on tap, so you're sure to find something you like. The staff is friendly and they try their hardest to get to everyone. On certain nights they have live music playin in the corner. Not a lot of room, so it's usually a one or two piece band. \n\nI'm not worried, but I hope that this place sticks around. This area needs them.	2
911	All I can say is wow. Easily some of the best Italian food I've had. You certainly get what you pay for, the portions are no joke. If you are in the mood for a classy, delicious Italian dinner... this is the place to go!	4
912	"This place replaced the old Pickup Stix, redecorated the place but unfortunately the food isn't authentic nor does it justifies the price.\n\nThe server is extremely helpful and friendly. The portions generous but the flavor isn't there. \n\nFor $8.50 you have a good array of dinner menus to choose from and for around $5 for lunch. Specials include egg rolls, wontons, soup, choice of rice and chow mein. \n\nI ordered \""double cooked pork\"", it isn't double cooked pork. Rather it is just some veggies bbq pork stir fry. It was very disappointing and they should not have put the name up if the item is not what it's suppose to be. \n\nMy friend ordered sesame chicken and it turned out to be orange chicken with about 20 pieces of sesame on one piece of nugget. I'm not exaggerating. \n\nanyway, probably won't be coming back to this place. Quite unfortunate because it has potential and a good service."	1
913	"i didnt know what rating to give. its a toss up or should i say -- its a crap shoot. hahha\n1.chips and salsa - good\n2. vegan salad and rolled tacos - good\n3. beer and tequila - goooood\n4. is where i have a problem - seeing guys from AFI ? does pink taco get another star cause we seen those guys?? - good??\n5. eating pink taco 2 days in a row - not good!!! unless you need to \""cleanse\"" if you know what i mean."	2
914	This was my second tapas place to visit in Las Vegas. \n\nThe food was ok, nothing really stood out other than the paella. It was a 40 minute wait, but worth it to try at least once!\n\nThe service was top notch, from the moment you walk thru the entrance to the wait staff, manager, everyone made you feel welcome. \n\nThe price, OH THE PRICE!   Only complaint I would say.  The entire menu is seriously over priced, even by Las Vegas Strip standards. It's the reason it will not be coming back. There are far better places to go for tapas on the Vegas strip for a better price & value. And important a better selection.\n\nThe atmosphere is great!  Plenty of light, open, not stuff. It has a bar area as well. The noise level is on the average. And the place is clean, they did a pretty good job clearing the table as you was done.  \n\nAll in all, I thought this place was OK at best.  But there are much much better places to visit.	2
915	I stopped by to check this place out, maybe get some juice, ended up leaving with the provari kit (too good of a deal to pass up) and a bottle of juice custom made by the sales person helping me. \nIf you haven't been here yet you are missing out. Great selection, great prices, and great customer service!	4
916	The place is small but they have a patio that appears to accomodate as many folks outside as the actual dining room.  Menu is above register which is also where the baked goods case is located.  Makes it difficult to come in and view the case while someone is placing their order.  Intersting menu items and decadent looking desserts.  That Napoleon LOOKS impressive.  If I make it back here I WILL be having one of those.  I ordered a scramble with spinach in it -can't recall the name.  It was just okay.  It was more like a fluffy, undercooked omelette.  That could be a HUGE problem if I had been dining here with my spouse but for me, eh, no worries.    The macaroon was interesting but not like a traditional macaroon, much bigger to start.  Have to say it was rather tasty too.  My issue with this place -\nIt took so long to get our food.  For almost $24.00 I could get a full breakfast served and my coffee refilled.  I just don't think you get your money's worth here and the long wait just took it off of my places I bookmark.  For a week day the place was hopping and the parking lot was crazy -and it wasn't even close to the lunch hour.	1
917	Always wanted to try. Not impressed. Their signature drink frozen hot drinks were somewhat a little disappointing. Too sweet, tasted like a slushy melted ice cream. We had the chicken and waffles for breakfast... Ummmm no!!! Chicken too dry, potato too dry and waffles just lack that umpf! Pricing was a little over priced for the food that you ca	1
918	this place is wonderful. it's family owned and usually stays open til 7. on occassion, there will be a wait, but it is SO worth it. i am obsessed with chicken fingers, and these BY FAR, have got to be my favorite in tempe (yes, even above the beloved tenders at four peaks). i would recommend getting your tenders buffalo style with the sweat and sour sauce... but i've tried all combos, and they are all delicious, it just depends on what flavor you feel like that day. I LOVE THIS PLACE.	4
919	I had a good stay. Loved the pool, Sayers club and Bazaar! Check in was a pain in the ass but with that aside it was good.	3
920	"I was so excited for the long awaited Sushi Brokers to open in Arcadia.   I fully expected it would be my new local \""go-to\"" sushi place, as it is just a few blocks from my office and from my home.    \n\nWe've gone for lunch and have hit it up for evenings on several occasions.   Overall, the food is good and the service is quality.  The only qualm I have is on the price.  Very few lunch specials ($15 Bento box) so it's definitely not somewhere we can go frequently as it is definitely beyond my lunch budget.   They do have a good happy hour, but otherwise the prices are higher than other places around.  \n\nNonetheless - the important part - FOOD!  The sushi seems very fresh and they have some great, creative rolls to try (Cowboy, Cowgirl).  Tootsie roll is always a favorite.  Spicy tuna roll is my favorite, and they definitely do this one very well - great flavor and just the right amount of heat!  The Bento box with sushi is a good and filling lunch option (with miso soup, veggies, an orange).  Tuna Tataki was a great choice.   The sashimi is good, but the portions are on the smaller side in comparison with other sushi places in the area. \n\nFood: 4 stars\nService: 4 stars\nPrice: 2 stars \nOverall:  3.5 stars\n\nWith that said, happy hour is definitely the time to go enjoy Sushi Brokers.   There is regular happy hour until about 6:30, I believe, and then a reverse happy hour that starts at 10 pm.  I just wish there were better lunch deals or locals had discount options - or even daily specials would be great.   Until then...expect Biltmore or North Scottsdale prices and plan accordingly."	2
921	My God! This place keeps getting better and better!!! Even when they're so busy that the line is out the door around the corner!!!!	4
922	This place recently re-opened after being closed for a little while. My family and I decided to order some pizza's for dinner. Just awful!  Worst mistake ever. BIG BIG disappointment. Little Cesar's $5 pepperoni is better than this garbage. I used to like Rosati's but this order ruined it for me. I'll never order pizza from this place ever again.	0
923	Garbage company.  Took a town car from the airport to our hotel, set up the return trip with the driver.  His name was Ashley Silver, and he never reserved the return trip.  Called the company to confirm last night and they knew nothing about us.  So we set up a car for this morning at 6am, and when it was almost too late to get another service we get an email saying there was no car available.  \n\nDO NOT use this lousy company or you will likely end up stuck somewhere.	0
924	It's a very very good pizza. Been their 3 times  the only draw back is very dark in the parking lot.	3
925	"I have been to Brio many times at Town Square and once at Tivoli.  Tonight the service was so so, but the food was the star again.  This time I had the steak salad.  Often times restaurants just \""phone it in\"" on steak salad, but this one was fantastic.  I asked for medium and it was cooked perfectly, very well seasoned meat.  I asked for no pecans and asked for the creamy parmesan dressing instead of the horseradish.  In my opinion, it is THE BEST dressing there.  I will always enjoy a visit to Brio."	3
926	Hungover and driving back to LA after a long weekend of partying, we hit up Mr. Tofu for some grub.\n\nService was extremely slow, since there was ONE waiter. He seemed to favor the Korean patrons and served them first. Whatever.\n\nI just wanted my noodle soup. I had the anchovy handmade noodle soup and it was ginormous. Noodles were handmade for sure, but where the hell were the anchovies?!! I didn't see any, and it sure didn't look like the photo they posted on the wall. \n\nThe noodles were decent, but kinda bland. OH well, it hit the spot and got rid of the edginess. \n\nMy friend had the seafood tofu and she liked it alot. \n\nTotal for two people was $20. Not bad. \n\nBut, probably won't be coming back here. I'll hit up the Pho place next door over this. \n\nPix- http://pandaliciousforme.blogspot.com	2
927	"Bar none- worst service ever. I'm not a picky person, I understand that being a waiter can suck, so I try to not make it difficult. However, the staff at Lolita's need's lessons in: 1. Professionalism, 2. Time management 3. Basic manners 4. Service. The food was good,( to bad it was brought out by the WORST waiter ever). \nThe story- husband and I were on date and faster a movie decided to check out lolita's. When hostess tried to seat us, there was only one chair, so my husband had to stand there until she borrowed one from another table, ooops akward. We then got chips quickly, and waited ten minutes for the waiter to show up. He was distracted, didn't intro himself, and pretty much acted like he was doing us a favor by standing there. My husband started to order, and then I waffled for literally three seconds over what I wanted to order, and the waiter clearly annoyed said, \""oh sorry, I'll be back, I've gotta give a guy his check\"". Ok, that was a little rude. Why didnt he take care of that before coming to take our order?Well,  then I watched him proceed to go inside, gab with some bus boys, decide to print a check, give it to the customer, and refill other tables drinks, take orders, and forget us for another ten minutes. By this time, we haven't even gotten drinks.  Finally he graces us with his presence again, and admittedly a little snarky, I ask him if he is ready now? He gives me the B#%ch you will pay for that face, and takes our order. Goes on to serve the other tables, refills drinks and generally completely ignores us. Then brings our drinks. Doesn't say a word, sets them down, annnnnd never comes back. He instead continues to serve all the tables around us, blatantly avoiding ours, and giving me the stink eye. Our food comes out, no refills, no how's the food from him. And, of course, my food it cold, not just \""sitting out to long\"" cooled down, but \"" I just took these out of the freezer cold\"". Yum. (on a side note, I Never send anything back, I think I'm pretty easy going) so I ask a passing server if they could just heat the tacos up? And can we get some refills? He was wonderful, sure no prob. Drinks refilled, food hot and very tasty. Our waiter still turns his back on us, and helps all other tables. My husband had to ask for the check when he was serving the table next to us. We got it and did not stay to wait the table for him to get the check, we would have been there all night.  Also, we were supposed to get a free dessert, and We were so pissed, we didn't even stay to get that. Complained to the manager, he comp'd dinner, normally I'd be like, oh that made up for it. Nope, that confirmed it for me, I am never going back, it wasn't worth the free meal. The little piss ant waiter with the stink eye and attitude did it for me."	0
928	Everytime I go to this places I am surprised.  I just expect it to be bad but the food is actually really good. I have had a salad, a sandwich, and a melt. All were good good. : ) The service is always friendly to boot.	3
929	The Grandview Saloon has one of the best views of Pittsburgh from Mt. Washington from its patio. The views from the interior of the restaurant are not bad either.  To go with your view, you can choose from a good selection of drinks and more mediocre Pittsburghesque (i.e., comfort) food. The design of the patio is fine, but the interior of the restaurant is very plain. This is a shame, because with a little work on the interior design and menu, the view could make this one of the city's most interesting restaurants. \n\nIn short, I would not go here to celebrate an anniversary, but it's a good place to take first-time visitors to see the city while enjoying a tasty beverage.	2
930	I had usually gone to Shepard Eye Center.  I was due for my exam, and with 6 doctors at multiple locations, the soonest they could get me in was 2 months!  I found out that Optic Gallery accepted my insurance, called them, and they got me in within 3 days!!  The service was outstanding!  Dr. Nguyen was great, and so was the staff.  \n\nI was upsold on lenses, and there is a contact lense fitting fee, but it's a small price to pay.  I chose to get the lenses that they recommended, and I choose to wear contacts too.  Just waiting until I can be a candidate for LASIK.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend them.	3
931	"Rosatti's doesn't deliver to Verona (I can't blame them), so we decided to call Falbo's.  And that's when we discovered Falbo's in Verona closed and is now \""AJ's Pizzeria and Diner\"" (thankfully the phone number is the same).\n\nAn extremely helpful and friendly gentleman answered the phone, informed us of the recent change, and offered their web address so that we could browse the new menu.  After a quick peek, we called back and placed the order: spinach cheese bread, a garden salad, and a large thin crust pie with the gold-standard for toppings (sausage, onion, mushroom, green peppers).\n\nWe were quoted a delivery time of around 40 minutes, which seemed totally fair.  After we hung up and poured a glass of vino, the phone rang - a computer glitch wiped out part of the delivery address; the gentleman was extremely apologetic - it wasn't a big deal at all.  These guys seem like super friendly and helpful folks.\n\nAfter less than 25 minutes, the doorbell rang and our bounty had arrived.  The driver was very professional and friendly as well - seems like they want to really make a good impression with their customers.  \n\nWe started with the salad; it was huge, and very fresh.  The slices of tomato were a bit unusual, but all things considered, the salad was good.  It featured cukes, tomato, onion, bell peppers and croutons (which appeared to be pre-made).\n\nFrom the salad, we tried the spinach cheese bread, which featured a french loaf, cut in half, buttered, and topped with fresh spinach and mozzarella cheese, which was then baked/melted.  The bread wasn't real crisp - my guess is that it sat in the styrofoam container too long and probably steamed itself a bit.  We saved it and will reheat it in the oven.\n\nThe pizza looked excellent - perfect thickness of the crust; plenty of uber-fresh toppings, and just the right amount of cheese.  We dug-in, and while the outer part of the crust was nice and crisp, the center had gone soft, just like the spinach cheese bread did.  Again, I'm guessing it's because we left it in the box for too long, or that the fresh veggies ended-up steaming the pizza a bit as it cooked?  \n\nDespite the flopping inner crust, the pizza was superb.  The sauce was excellent, the sausage was delish, and the veggies were cut thin and piled high.  We both ate more than we should've, but it tasted soooo good we couldn't stop ourselves.\n\nI'll definitely order from AJ's again, and will ask for the crust to be a little more well done.  I also wonder if a sheet of parchment or something on the bottom during transport would help keep things more crisp?  \n\nI wish these guys the best of luck with the new venture.  Give them a try!\n\nAJ's = WIN\n\nFood = 3.5 stars\nService = 5 stars (fast, friendly, helpful)\nValue = 4.25 stars\n\nI'd prefer to rate AJ's as 3.5 - 3.75 stars, but aside from the softish crust, it was a 4+ star experience, so we'll bump 'em up a bit."	3
932	My husband and I have spent a few afternoons just chilling out at Brocach with friends. The atmosphere is just so cozy at both the bar and dining area. The servers and bartenders are very attentive and fun.\nThey have a great selection of beer and I absolutely LOVE the food!!!!\n\nThe duck fat fries are ridiculous... I don't know why that appetizer exists, but I am so glad it does. YUM!!!! Brocach also has delicious wings with very unique and tasty sauce options. The Guiness stout sauce is probably my favorite.\n\nI usually order the baked Mac and Cheese for dinner because it's incredible. I should probably venture out and get something else one of these days... But I just love that dish too much. My husband likes the burgers a lot and everyone I have ever dined with here enjoyed their meals immensely. Can't wait to go back!	3
933	Needs to communicate better.	1
934	After over two years, I finally returned to Wicked Spoon. On my first visit, I wasn't a fan of the small plates concept, but on this occasion that was the least of my complaints. \n\nMy friend was in town and wanted to try a buffet. We were leaning towards Bacchanal, but my fella insisted on giving Wicked Spoon another try since we weren't really in the mood to stand in a long line for dinner. We arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday and there was no line at all. I have to admit, this scared me off a bit. This is peak buffet-eating time and there was no line, it just didn't seem right. \n\nWe paid and were seated within 2 minutes of arriving. Service was friendly, but we had to wait quite a bit of time to get drink orders in. On several occasions I had to ask other servers that were meandering around if we could order drinks and refills. After this coaxing our server did arrive and take our orders. We made sure to order refills as he was placing our drinks down after having to wait one too many times with nothing to drink. As a thirsty girl, that's a pet peeve of mine, keep those refills coming.\n\nThe food wasn't too exciting either. I actually had a hard time deciding on anything. I wandered around around much longer than I usually do at buffets and ended up with the same things over and over. The only things I had any interest in eating were the kalbi and assorted veggies I found on the line.\n\nI don't see myself returning to this buffet any time soon. Definitely not worth the $40 price tag.	1
935	It was a first time I had to take one of my pups to the hospital and it was extremely serious. The staff and doc took great care of my little one and was awesome about communicating everything to us. The doc was great about personally calling and then also following up 2 weeks after. I would recommend taking your animal here.	4
936	"My lousy experience with this Jimmy John's started with an overcharge on my debit card. I ordered 1 sandwich and 1 bag of chips for a delivery. The delivery was fast and the food was good, so lets get that out there to be fair. I added an extra star because the food here has always been fine.\n\nI logged into my bank account like I normally do, and there was a $19 charge from Jimmy's. That's one expensive sandwich.\nI called three times. Spoke to \""managers\"" 3 times. My information was taken, and all 3 times, my call was never returned.\nI went there in person; Once again, my information taken, no call returned. There was a general \""I have no idea how to handle this, I'm going to call my boss/area manager\"" and then nothing.\nThis is really poor customer service. My call should have been returned the first day-a courtesy \""I am handling it, I will get your card refunded asap, apologies, etc. \n\nOver charging a customer is a big deal. I gave the tip in cash, so I know that I did not key in a wrong amount when I placed my order online.\n\nThis was their mistake, and no effort was made on behalf of the management to help me.\nThey've lost my business."	1
937	"The sushi was so so, service was mediocre and the drink \""hello kitty martini\"" is the furthest thing from a martini. Ultimately dissatisfied."	0
938	Three words: bland, expensive, bland. I went with a friend and she ordered a ham sandwich and I ordered crab cakes. We were both disappointed and found this place way OVERRATED. I think you pay for the atmosphere because the food is just your average lunch.	0
939	After hearing several people Rave about Pho Kim Long, I decided to check it out; and I can say I was not disappointed.\n\nThe place is fairly big and we were seated immediatley (there can be a wait but they burn and turn pretty fast). The staff was attentive and we had several people swing by the table to make sure we were doing OK.\n\nThe menu is impressive, I was just expecting your average Pho place, but they menu covers much more, apps, Pho, entrees, smoothies, and much much more.\n\nI decided on the #11 Rare Steak and Brisket Pho. I also got an order of the Chinese Doughnuts to start.\n\nMy only complaint is that the doughnuts were plain, when I usually order them they're covered in sugar, but a little quick thinking and I was using the remaining Peanut Sauce from my companion's spring rolls for a great dish.\n\nThe Food came out insanely fast, the apps were good, but the Pho stole the show. The Steak and Brisket were both tender and delicious. The noodles were plentiful, and the broth was rich.\n\nI will be going back without a doubt!	3
940	Holy moly, why have I never heard of the pasty for the so many years I've been alive!?  Simply put, the pasty is the premium version of an empanada....and a super deluxe version of a hot pocket.  \n\nThe boy and I drove here Saturday night around 8:30. The place was packed, and we waited about 15 minutes for a place to sit.  We were, as many others have mentioned, confused about where to go to get seated. A guy beyond the counter told us to just find an empty table to sit. I tried his technique and was stopped by another guy who told us to wait, and he'll get us a table.  \n\nI asked our server to see what's the most popular pasty, and he said there is one single pasty that sells more than the other.  So I would just suggest go with what you're feeling for the day.  I ended up with The Royales with Cheese, and my boy got the Bangers and Mash.  The Royales is basically a cheeseburger stuck inside the delicious, warm, buttery crust.  It had a weird garlic taste to it, which I didn't care for. The thousand island that came with on the side didn't go well with my pasty.  I still garbled that thing up regardless though.  I tried a piece of the Bangers and Mash, and I'm not a fan of it. I don't normally like eating pork, so I wouldn't have ordered this.  The boy really enjoyed it though.  \n\nNow, unto the BEST part of the meal...this is none other than their Banoffe Pie.  I HAD to get this even though I was already stuffed.  I have never had anything like this. Thick, crispy graham with creamy, homemade caramel, topped with whipped cream and slices of banana.  I've got a sweet tooth, and that banoffe was definitely one of the best desserts I have ever had!  I would definitely come back to this place again and again the next time I'm back in Arizona.	4
941	The Garden is definitely an ok place to fill up your gas tank while you munch on some fresh produce, that is if you get a hankering to do so while traveling through Middleton, WI.	1
942	Their food is okay, but they continuously change their menu and business name. It's very very irritating and confusing. I am done ordering from this place.	1
943	Patience is required as they take their sweet time and it isn't even busy. It's been 30 minutes and I don't know that they'll be done soon. I would come back because it's cheap but definitely not during 'rush' hour.	2
944	I don't even want people to know about this place because I'll have to wait longer, but wowzers, amazing flavors.  The sides (or three) are the real stars here.  The fried brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes were my favs.  The brisket was a little chewier than I'd like.  One of your sides can be these little dessert cups.  Delicious!	4
945	This place is bomb!!! Love kimchi fried rice + 4 skewers!! HEAVEN!	4
946	Typically a nickel to seven cents cheaper than the national average and a better than average store. Always congested and on a very busy corner, but worth the stop just in gas savings.	2
947	Had dinner here this past Saturday night.  Was wowed from start to finish, was greeted right away and sat for our 8:00PM Reservation.  Had an extremely knowledgeable waitress named Rachel that made fantastic recommendations based on the true preparation of the dishes.  There was too much that we wanted to try on their far from ordinary menu, full of interesting dishes.  We went with the Beef tartar appetizer which was so fantastic, smooth, flavorful and the delicious egg topped it off perfectly.  We also tried the tuna taquitas which were great as well.  The Fried Pickles are a must have, the breading is incredible but they are huge.  For entrees we enjoyed the Moules Frites with White Wine Garlic Broth, which the girlfriend said where some of the best she ever had.  I enjoyed their signature duck dish, this was such fresh meat but what really made it for me was the pastrami edging.  The sauerkraut pierogoies were a nice side of the dish aswell.  Dont miss out on their drinks, this was the best Manhattan cocktail ive ever had!  Also enjoyed a drink called the Perfect Sour, that was a great addition similar to a Pisco Sour.  Will be returning soon with plenty of options to try !	4
948	Sat for twenty minutes before someone arrived at the table. Service very slow. Meal arrived having sat under a heat lamp. Steak ordered medium rare was now dry and well done. Eggs were dead. Wine list had nice selection.	1
949	Though the address may say Rainbow, you can't get there from here because the road remains unpaved some 4 years after the Sturtz family opened this restaurant. So forget the GPS and check the restaurant's website for alternative directions. The restaurant is very homey and literally decorated with bric-a-brac taken from their home. We each ordered easy over eggs which came with bacon and home fries. My wife, in a senior moment, substituted 2 hot cakes for the toast. Everything was expertly prepared using high quality ingredients though my wife never came close to finishing her lumberjack sized meal.	3
950	Came to watch Hockey and have a couple drinks....no sound and was told they don't turn it up. It disturbs the gamers. Why bother having the TV's. won't be back	0
951	Went here because they had a sign that there was a brunch, turns out it's only Saturday and Sunday. The food was cafeteria like for $18 each. Good service from our waiter. You're killing me LVH with your restaurants, Benihanas was the only awesome restaurant. We are going elsewhere right now for dinner.	1
952	Really good Ahi Tuna steak, especially if you're drunk and need something to even out the alcohol. Servers are nice and quick.	3
953	I'm sitting at the bar at this moment and have been sitting here for 20 minutes now and haven't been greeted by a single bar tender, waitress or any staff at all.	0
954	First off let me say this, if you want authentic French cousine... go elsewhere this isn't anything close to resembling real french cuisine.\n\nThat being said, we went here for a birthday dinner.  The atmosphere was charming and quaint.  The waitstaff was kind and willing to explain if there were any questions.  The food... was... boring.  Completely boring.  There was nothing resembling what i have expected.  Being that I've eaten real french cousine cooked by a frence chef, this was a let down.  At almost 300 for all of us... I would never, ever go there again.  Even the desert was lacking.  The wine was bland.  The entree was overcooked and underwhelming.\n\nThey should consider hiring a chef who is familiar with authentic french cousine, or change the name of the joint.	1
955	This place was very much needed in this part of Glendale to save the area and bring some more people back after the fizzle of hype that has been drained from Westgate. I was surprised when I rolled back into town and saw the outlet mall as I previously lived at Westgate and remember nothing but the huge parking lot.  Nice stores, good prices, but lacking a food court.  Your basic outlet stores (CK, NIKE, jewelry stores, etc) so nothing too special but decent prices.  I bought four CK shirts for the price of when one would've costed originally.  Hopefully it continues to bring people back to Westgate and bring some business back!	3
956	"This hotel wasn't ready for the amount of guests that it booked. They double booked our room even though we had made reservations months in advance. we were finally given a room (hours later).  we went out to enjoy our day/night, when we came back we discovered our keys no longer opened our doors. We had to  go back down to the lobby at 4am to get new keys.  To top off this horrific weekend stay,the hotel has a  resort fee that they neglect to tell you about when you check-in.  However,  I asked Prytzel (my desk clerk) if there were any other fees I needed to pay when I checked in.  She said \""no unless you use room service.\"" I had to debate with my check-out clerk, Cora, about not paying this fee that was not mentioned to me at my check-in or displayed at the check-in counter. This place is terrible. We will not stay here ever again."	0
957	I did my research on yelp on vegas buffets prior to arrival.  Since I stayed at the MGM, I thought I'd give The Buffet at Bellagio a try.  \n\ni went on a tuesday, no wait.  went in at 3pm for the lunch price like what the other yelpers suggested to do, and ate lunch and dinner food.  The only difference between lunch and dinner was that they offered sashimi and instead of flank steak, they had prime ribs.  Big whoop.  \n\nMost of the yelpers said it's one of the best buffets in Vegas.  After I started eating for a while, I wondered if I actually went into the right hotel....  To think that Bellagio is one of the bigger and nicer hotels and yet they fail to even make sushi, wow that sucks.  Their super generic sushi is even worse than ones at Safeway.  Heck, even my friends can make better sushi than that!! \n\nThe flank steak was chewy as heck.  the leg of lamb tasted more like duck.  I only went to this buffet a few days ago, and I can't even remember what I ate because nothing stood out!!! \n\nI guess i have to try all the other shitty buffets in vegas before I'll appreciate the wonders of the buffet at bellagio.  until then it's still 2 stars in my book.	1
958	So, funny I just read the previous review.  I am in the same boat, i.e. I have been known to drive from Chicago to Madison to see Nicole.  I have been unable to replace her... ;-(  Her cuts and colors are consistently good.  \n\nShe is great and was recently promoted to manager... kudos, she deserves it!	4
959	Unfortunately there is nothing special about this place. My husband got the french dip and myself the mushroom panini. Mine was rather disappointing, the mushrooms were minced so tiny and the flavor was semi reminiscent of canned cream of mushroom soup....on a sandwich. I hate leaving bad reviews but it wouldn't help anyone if i lied, sorry.	0
960	I booked this room (the Vdara suite specifically) for a bachelorette party with two other girls.  Never in my life would I had been able to afford this alone, but hey, when there's a bachelorette party you need to plan for, then you try to find the best...\n\nFirst of all, the place is freakin' HUGE!  I'm talking large bedroom, insanely large bathroom, huge dining room and living room.  As if that wasn't enough, they have a full refrigerator with an electric stove and plenty of cabinet space.  The only thing that's missing to this whole kitchenette experience is an oven, but hey, I certainly hope you don't expect to be waiting around all night for food to heat up in the oven.  And in case, let's say, you need a washer and dryer, well then, good thing you brought clothes cause they have that too!  There's even a half bathroom located next to the dining room, complete with toilet and sink (in case you don't have time to stumble into the other bathroom of course).  We had a total of 6 girls come up for dinner at the room, which we stocked in the fridge with PLENTY of alcohol!  The shower has a sit down area for those ladies (or guys too!) who want to shave their legs as well as two sinks, a separate bathtub, and plenty of towels!  We ordered more towels, though, and some more dishware, which was brought up promptly to our room.  \n\nMy only gripe is that there is no self parking for Vdara.  You have to park in Aria or simply valet your car in Vdara, which is easier.  This caused a little bit of confusion for a couple of friends, but once they got settled and saw the apartment like hotel, nothing else mattered except the PAR-TAY!\n\nOne other thing, the pool is amazing!  It's crowded by noon, but my friend and I awoke when the pool opened (9am) to enjoy the pool, which also had a hot tub!  It was nice to enjoy before the peeing children and their parents could make their way into swimsuits and make me cringe at the thought of even putting my feet into the pool.  Definitely give it a go if you find yourself awake early and sober!\n\nIt was worth every penny.   And yes, the hotel itself does connect  to the Bellagio hotel!  Um...more adventure, all right!	4
961	Virgin America Airlines is by far one the best domestic airlines. Well, when it comes to style, comfort & service. On the back of each seat it has a personal tv. So, it's nice to have. I would've given them 5 stars BUT they charge $25 for check in. I actually don't have a prob with it because I always have a carry on.	3
962	Went there after the club waiting to get my hands on some wings...after waiting for a table for 30 minutes, we sat down only to find out that they DISCONTINUED THE DAMN 25cent WINGS!!!!  It's $7.99 now for 10 wings and fries, BS.....anyways, it is cheap food price and quality wise.  You get what you pay for.  Waiter messed up the order, but whatever.\n\nAnd if you want wings tossed in butter, get mild...:/	1
963	"My wife and i went for lunch last week.  The food was so so and the service was a bit slow.  We both got lunch specials that came with soup, spring roll and fried wontons.  The soup was not what I would call a traditional Thai soup, the spring roll was too greasy, and the wontons were bland.  My wife got the yellow curry and I got Panang.  I ordered mine \""Thai spicy\"" but it was more like medium.  Next time we go for Thai we'll try the Thai Cafe which is just a mile or so away."	2
964	The Platinum is a very nice hotel.  You don't pay top prices, and you get almost-luxury.\n\nEvery room - even the smallest - are very large suites, all with balconies and full kitchens.  The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable.  I didn't use much of the kitchen or living room so I can't comment there, but the bed was super comfy.  The gigantic jacuzzi tub was awesome, as were the two sinks, and the two tvs (though I only used the one in the bedroom).  \n\nThere were a few less-than-luxury elements I noticed, such as there being no bedsheet and the comforter being put on backwards, one of the water handles on the tub leaking, a complicated and ultimately non-working alarm clock, and a lack of hot-enough water in the shower two of my three mornings (though certainly nowhere near cold).  But, it was a really nice stay for the price.  The wifi worked great.\n\nThe staff is very nice and let you alone, and the valet attendants are extremely friendly, quick, and helpful.  The pool area seemed nice, though it was late December  so aside from checking it out I didn't visit it (though I probably would have for the jacuzzi had I not had the jetted tub of my own).\n\nThe hotel was quiet and the room service menu looked great, though I didn't try it.  The fitness center is what you'd expect - a hardwood floor room with three large TVs, 4 treadmills, 3 ellipticals, 2 bikes, and weights and benches.  My only complaint is that there was heat blasting straight on you every 10 minutes.  Not awesome, but whatever.  \n\nThe Platinum is a great choice if you want a nice place that ISN'T on the strip, but is easily within walking distance.	3
965	Location: Plateau-ish area, near Laurier metro. Street parking available but pay attention to the signs.\n\nThe place: It's small, decor is minimal, and there's a pool table that in't very strategically positioned in the middle of the place. I'm still trying to figure that one out since if you happen to be sat right behind said pool table, you risk having your back or arse poked with a stick. Anyway. The theme here, is 80s-90s, which I can tolerate in small doses but not so much for an entire evening. The wait staff (at least the gals) are outfitted in retro 80s gear and the music being played is genre, Londonbeat, Madonna, Micheal Jackson etc. \n\nThe food: I went for Burger week. Will I go back? Nope. I orderd the veggie burger, also known as the Humus burger; while the bun itself was actually quite good, the patty was just this brown lump that, at first glance, didn't look very appetizing. Was it good? It was OK but I've had better Falafel-style patties elsewhere. Half my burger was missing the bottom so I basically ate that half with a knife and fork while I ate the other as a burger should be eaten: with my bare hands. The burger was topped with lettuce, tomato, exactly two sweet potato chips, and was accompanied by coleslaw. No fries included. As far as burgers go, it was dull. The coleslaw was spicy and just not good. Spicy coleslaw just doesn't work for me. My date ordered a meat burger that she said was burnt, and the accompanying fries were cold. \n\nService: The service was fine, but the waitress didn't explain the two different burgers that were on offer for Burger week (we told her that's why we were there). It was also incredibly slow to actually get our food - maybe that's why the fries were cold. On the up side, we weren't pressed to leave when were done. \n\nPrice point: $11 for the veggie burger. Personally, if you're going to give me a mediocre burger and not include fries, $11 is overpriced.	1
966	"So who wouldn't love to see the biggest chocolate fountain in the world? It's Vegas so it is only appropriate for everything to be gaudy and that is exactly what Jean Philippe did. \n\nEverything tasted just wonderful and all the desserts are made with great care and attention to detail. My only problem was that there is not seating and the wait staff move at an extreme glacial pace. There is one side for coffee and crepes and there is another side just for desserts. It's never marked which side is which so I had no idea where to go. The worst part is I wanted both a dessert and a crepe and both the lines were long and slow! What on earth was I supposed to do? When I finally got to the front of the line I asked the man if there was any way that I could put in an order for a crepe even though I was on the dessert side and instead of saying \""let me see what I can do\"" he huffed and puffed and told me what a trouble it was going to be for him and I should just wait in both lines next time. HOW RUDE! That single moment pretty much ruined my entire experience. Then 20 min later I finally get my food and I have to find a bench somewhere just to eat my now soggy crepe."	2
967	Ok I give the park 3 stars but 1 star for the surf hour it's a bummer because of the locals that go there.  The guy that runs the surf shop is a d-bag. Me and my buddy were sharing my board so I would wait in line till there session was done and then he would bring the board to me and vice versa. So I waited in line my buddy brings my board to me and mr surf shop says I need to go to the back of the line if I'm sharing a board and wait.... I just waited I told him and I'm not going to the back of the line, he said its a rule. I asked who's rule? He said its an unspoken rule the regulars made.... Kiss my.... I just waited and you want me to wait again just cause I'm sharing a board what kind of bs is that I paid money to ride just like everyone else. If you want to have fun don't surf here, not worth the wait or the bs or the 3 second ride  or the money.......	0
968	We called to confirm price AND went online for estimates. The dispatcher told us it would be less than $15. We got to our destination the clock said 10.50 but they said they had to charge us an additional $12! He blamed it on a new dispatcher. Sorry that is not our problem. We will choose another company next time.	0
969	This is my favorite AYCE sushi place in Vegas. Quick turnover rate. Good selection of sushi and non-sushi items. No real time limit. I almost always order the sashimi salad and short ribs. You can also have the salad with the sauce on the side. My friends do that in order to keep the sauce for dipping other sushi in. Personally, I just like being the one to decide how much sauce I want in my salad. I've been here a handful of times already, and I'll likely continue going.	3
970	"What can I say. Disappointed!! Very disappointed. Especially after reading the Yelp reviews. I did a lot of research on where to eat in Las Vegas. I did not want to pay the $200.00 plus price tag of some of the top top rated places, but, I am a foodie and wanted a memorable meal. \nFirst, my partner and I had a reservation, and were seated at an extremely large 4-6 top table (I usually appreciate a big table) however, this was completely impersonal. By the way we were eating at 6:30 p.m. so it was not crowded. We asked for another table and were seated at a banquette. The server arrived, but acted as if he was not expecting company. \nThe best experience was with the sommelier, whose name unfortunately I cannot remember. He gave great recommendations for glasses of wine and even brought tastes for my partner. He was very friendly and nice to talk to(more later).\nMy partner ordered the kobe beef burger and I ordered the San Francisco Cioppino (imagining that this would be stellar given Michael Mina's roots).  The burger was terrific, the fries however, were over salted(I am a salt lover, so really too much) and frankly pretty ordinary. \nNow to my Cioppino, first, it was obvious from the first bite that the fish and shellfish were pre-cooked, no, really. I could not believe it, also, the temperature of the whole dish was off. The \""broth\"" which is actually more like a tomato saucea was not hot enough, too thick and just bland and ordinary tasting. The combination of the pre-cooked fish and shellfish was really not good. I only ate the lobster tail and the scallop(also not cooked correctly). The sommelier came by towards the end of the meal and asked how everything was (the server never returned to ask). I asked him if he really wanted to know and I told him about the above. I saw him tell the server, who never asked us and just brought us a trio of sorbets (the chocolate was yummy but the peach and mango tasted like Sharon's.) \nOverall, I would never recommend this restaurant or eat here again. I was glad to take the complimentary copy of WIne Spectator with Michael Mina on the cover, but would be reticent to try his restaurants again."	1
971	Conflicted is how I feel about Sauceman's. I went there the other week to grab a quick dinner since I purchased a $12 Groupon. I called in my order right as I was leaving work Uptown and by the time I got there, it was ready. Like that since anyone who has seen the size of my booty knows I like food. \n\nThe first thing I noticed when I stepped out of my car was the interesting location---right at the corner of West Blvd and South Tryon Street across from the Bojangles. Good thing I came down Camden since making it into the parking lot from Tryon Street seems like an impossible task. The second thing that hit me was the smell of sweet stuff in the air--was I in the parking lot of a Krispy Kreme?? I soon found out the smell was their sugar biscuits--sugar and biscuits living in harmony together? Say it aint so! But it be so and they were spectacular, more like little dough balls covered in sugar than biscuits though.  I got in, grabbed my pizza and salad to go but got talked into a $1.50 domestic draft that they have on Thursdays (along with $2 glasses of wine), for I just can't pass up a deal like that.\n\nI got the white pizza which has a  garlic/olive oil topping, provolone cheese and fresh sliced tomatoes. It was good but nothing memorable. I was hoping for a little more pizzazz or flavor to come with the pizza but when I got home and took a bite, I was underwhelmed. I added a ton of red pepper flakes and parsley to make it sparkle a little more and once I did, it was fabulous.\n\nLikes: Cheap prices for food and drinks, open seating area with lots of natural light and varied menu with both Italian and BBQ items and a friendly staff.\n\nDislikes: Unfavorable parking situation and location, lack of flavor of the food\n\nThe food was alright and a decent place to try but I don't think I will be saying you need to run right to Sauceman's anytime soon.	2
972	I was so excited to try out this new place for restaurant week. It's really hard to find...but cute inside once you get there. My party of 4 had reservations, but we still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. Our server brought us glasses of sangria (we didn't even notice at first that sangria came with the restaurant week menu, yay for free drinks!) Their red wine sangria was really good, with a nice star anise flavor. \n\nFor restaurant week, you split an appetizer with your dining companion, each had an entree (either 2 tacos or 1 burrito) and share dessert. We started with the taco salad, which was really tasty and spicy. I liked the chipotle ranch dressing and strips of tortilla on the top. \n\nI ordered the shrimp and barbacoa beef tacos - it said the beef is braised in Dr. Pepper. Interesting...they were out of shrimp and had to sub fish. The tacos came wrapped in 2 little corn tortillas, but they still fell apart when you pick them up. They were stuffed with things...but overall lacked flavor. I didn't finish either taco. We asked at this point for chips and salsa, which were brought out but horrible. I think we all ate one (burned) chip, with really thick, tomato-ey salsa with no freshness or kick.\n\nAt least you can't mess up dessert, right? I think it was a churro, but I wouldn't know because they were out. This happened the first day of restaurant week, about 730pm. They obviously didn't plan for restaurant week very well, because we didn't get dessert or and shrimp tacos. The waitress offered to get us another glass of sangria for dessert, but by this time we wanted to leave. \n\nSkip it.	1
973	FYI - if you plan to rent a car, allow extra time.  All of the car rental agencies are located in a separate terminal.  There's just one big bus to hop onto.  In light of the new TSA regs, they have little baggies for you to put your gels into [or lip glosses in my case].  Here's the interesting thing....At PHX they're drawstring... LAX has totally different bags....draw your own conclusions.....\n\n\nETA.  GGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....I had to update this review.  The only reason it's not one star is because my bag showed up....EVENTUALLY.  I recently had to check a bag from Phoenix to Oakland, because it takes more than a quart size bag of liquids and gels to maintain the Rhubarb for a week.  Somehow, my bag and I did not end up on the same flight.  They found it within 24 hours of me getting home.  But it was a LONG 24 hours, and they just weren't very nice about the whole thing.  At one point this chick asked what was in my bag....um, I don't know.  I told her I did not make a list because I did  not anticipate the neanderthals at PHX would lose my beloved Samsonite wheeley.  When she asked me what type of bag it was, I said, do you want a serial number????  \n\nOK, end rant.  let's hope they do better the next time.	1
974	Same as it ever was\nSame as it ever was\nSame as it ever was\n\n-- Talking Heads\n\nYeah, not much had changed in the 24 years that passed between my last two visits. You get a burger that's a little charred. Fries and onion rings are fairly good. The atmosphere is without pretension.	2
975	This place is the only reason why I want to go back to Vegas!!! the sushi is amazing, the ceviche taco's are mouth-watering. The seabass and lobster tail are scrumptious!! There wasn't one thing that was put on our table that wasn't delectable. Oh and the watermelon martinis are phenomenal! If it wasn't for our waiter MAX I don't think I would of had such a great experience. :)	4
976	"These guys are shady! They prey on you like used car salesman and the two (yes, TWO) that were helping us were not even on the same page. They tried to talk us into a \""promotion\"" that would lower our monthly data, however that then turned into us having to purchase two iPads at $49.99/ piece. I was honestly so pissed n frustrated that we just walked out (and I am usually not that rude). We will drive further just to be tested with respect"	0
977	We read the good reviews, and were surprised that the food was average at best.  The service was worse.  Our group of four just sat there thinking...is this the same place that had good reviews?   Apparently, people must be desperate for Italian in Henderson or don't get out much.  By the way, the art on the walls wouldn't sell at an arts and crafts fair...but they try to sell it do diners.   Swing and a miss.	1
978	Walked in, 3 minutes later had a new battery in my watch.  Way better than those places at the mall.	4
979	"Our family of 4 dined at Roy's on a Saturday evening for dinner. We walked in, were greeted and sat promptly at our reservation time. We were happy that we were seated in one of the off shoot rooms from the front area, much much less noisy. Waters were poured, server had introduced herself, complementary edamame were placed down and drink orders were taken. We ordered a Cosmo and a Martini on the rocks with extra olives. The Martini, came forgot the olives and there was a lime wedge with the Martini, wrong, sent it back and was redone and all was well.\n\nWe started off with appetizers of Tuna Poke and a Signature Roll, both very good. For entrees we had: Braised Short Ribs of Beef, Seared Sea Scallops, Blackened Island Ahi, and Tempura California White Sea Bass.\n\nAll were perfectly cooked and very good. I can't say anything bad, but for the prices, Roy's still had that \""Chain Restaurant\"" aura about it. Can't put my finger on it, maybe the decor, the amount of tables, the scent or the lighting? I think its a great fine dining family restaurant. Would I come here for a romantic evening, maybe not. Service and Food very good."	3
980	As Demetria said, this place is definitely hit and miss. If you want some good eats, get here early. They tend to run out of the real goodies.\n\nFried-chicken, when it isn't too overcooked/dried out, is a home run. I just wish they would perfect cooking it. I swear it alternates every other visit having it cooked perfectly.  Their six-cheese spaghetti is pretty good but can suffer the same fate at the chicken. Sides are plentiful to choose from. Mac-n-Cheese..same case as above. It's a home run if it hasn't been too burnt on top. Love their blackeyed peas and cornbread too. They might just have the best lemonade in Charlotte and I'm too scared to ask if it's just a brand-name mix. I really don't want to know. If you can bypass one of the volunteer's who fills up the drinks, you can make yourself a pretty slammin' Arnold Palmer.\n\nSpeaking of the volunteers, they're always extremely friendly and will even give you an extra dollop of mac-n-cheese if you know how to charm 'em like I do. Be sure to tip at the register.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter	2
981	I had a pretty good time at Bar Smith. I only drank beer so I can not comment on the well drinks. I spent 90% of my time up stairs on the roof where they were playing house music. I really enjoyed the videos playing on the wall over the bar. I found myself getting lost in them a bit, likely due to the beer consumption:) I only have two issues with the place: #1 the bathrooms were GROSS! There were only 2 stalls in the women's bathroom for the entire club! (There is an upstairs and a downstairs.) One stall was being used by a puking female and the other wouldn't flush. I get CHILLS thinking about it again. #2 One of the many bouncers, in an attempt to get somewhere quickly literally knocked me off my feet to get past me. While I understood his haste, I am a relatively small person and he was huge! The staff needs to be a little more considerate when plowing people over.	2
982	Run away. \n\nEvery sleazy stereotype of a car sales can be found at this location. Lies, manipulation, deception, and fast talking b.s. are all on the menu and served fresh daily. \n\nWalked away, nay ... ran, and never looked back.	0
983	Derald's is a popular fast food place and they do business from a small truck. They are located near Mathews Ave and Green St and another is at Mathews Ave and Springfield. Burgers are made-to-order and they are cheap.The fish burger (only on Fridays) is one of the best I have had but I don't think they use really fresh fish. It tastes really good with tartare sauce, onions and vinegar.	3
984	These bundt cakes are amazing! Definite must try.	4
985	Amazingly tasty pizza. Fresh taste from crust, sauce, and cheese.  The crust is perect in my book.  The toppings are interesting and a refresing change from tired Pittsburgh pizza toppings. Veggies were extra fresh.  Sausage and Pepperoni were tasty without taking over the flavor of the pizza.  Truthfully, I expected the prices to be way higher than what I paid.  The food is a bargain.  I would gladly pay more for all the fresh, home-made goodness, but I am overly pleased that they are reasonably priced.  Do try this pizza.  You won't be disappointed.	3
986	The airpot is splendid.  All the rental car locations are in one place, so you just need to find the one shuttle.\n\nBut what makes this airport better than others? They provide booties for you to wear when you take off your shoes, and ziplock bags in case you forgot to put your 3 oz. bottles of whatever liquids into ziplocks.  \n\nThe airpot does need some color though. From inside the terminals looking out, the entire airport looks sand-colored.	3
987	My family stopped here on a Friday afternoon during our vacation. It wasn't busy at all so our experience was a quiet one. \nThe atmosphere was beautiful inside and out!  If it hadn't been for the fact that it reached record high temps that day, we would've eaten outside. We were able to sit at a table right next to the pond and it was really fun to watch the ducks and turtles swim. \nWe were greeted and seated immediately, and our waiter was very attentive. My hubby and I both had the Pollo Fundido and is was soooo good!  The quality of the chicken was excellent!\nIt was also a fun little town to walk around after lunch. Next time we are in AZ we will be back!	4
988	This place is horrible! \n\nThe personnel are obnoxious and incompetent teenagers. The service will make you think it can't be real and that it must be a practical joke. The pizza is bad. The so called dining room is tiny and filled with little tables and cruelly uncomfortable metal chairs that have no cushioning. How does a place like this stay in business?	0
989	Bomb food! Plain and simple! The pretzel with fondue is sooooo yummy and I love the chicken and Gorgonzola salad! Plus it's central to old town, walking distance from the clubs or the mall- major bonus	3
990	"Went here for lunch last week and the place was packed, with a long line! We almost left, but they enticed us back with a fresh tray of lechon kawali (roast pork belly). I had Filipino-style corned beef and potatoes and oxtail stew (\""kare-kare\""). Boy were they good. Small, homey place, in a busy strip mall in a Chinese plaza. Lots of other foodstuffs for sale. The name of this place means \""neighbor\"", but literally it means \""house-connected\"" - shows you that Filipinos have close ties to their neighbors, as a culture. Price is reasonable as $6.50 for two viands and rice."	2
991	We have been to La Calabria a couple of times and the food has been excellent. The butternut squash ravioli is fantastic. Service is a little overwhelming. Give me some time to read the menu please. \nA little pricey for what you get. Made the mistake of having the house chianti. We did not care for it.	2
992	Everyone raves about this place, so I tied it. It was just ok. I've had better and worse. I had an Italian sub with chips and a drink. Nothing about the place or sandwich compels me for a return visit.	2
993	I have been frequenting Pita Jungle for over 7 years since I have moved to the Valley.  They WERE one of my favorite eateries.  I have hosted keynote speakers and workshop facilitators  from the college for lunch and dinner at Pita Jungle where we'd have upwards to 20 people at the restaurant and tip handsomely.\n\nToday for some reason I ,along with a group of friends, was ignored as we waited to be served.  We were seated and were not offered beverages until I began to wave my hands after sitting for 10 minutes.  The waters were brought to us by a reluctant host (no servers dared to approach the table...they all stared at one another) who told us that our server was busy but she'd be right with us.  Another seven minutes passed and she'd walked by our table six times and never looked in our direction.\n\nWe decided to leave the establishment and the overworked server that couldn't acknowledge a party of three (while servicing multiple tables AROUND ours.)  \n\nIn short, I will NOT be financially supporting Pita Jungle in the future. The lack of acknowledgement was so blatant that neighboring tables were looking at us and then looking at the server wondering what was going on...what a shame.	0
994	"In case some of you didn't already know, I spend alot of time at Coffe shops, namely Starbucks. It's like a second home really. Yesterday morning, in what my wife refers to as, one of my,\n\""My fit's of hopeless optimism.\""\nI figured I'd go and check out some of the Starbucks' running along on McDowell. Boy, wasn't that a mistake. Once inside, I had to look around to see if there was someone with a camera, waiting to gauge my reaction! That's how far off the reservation this Starbucks location had gone... I totally understand that alot of highschool kid's and young adults end up filling  part-time grocery store positions. In fact, I was one of those kids. I worked part time at a Safeway, where I grew up for over a year. But never, And I mean never, would you have caught me dead running the sort of ragtag, dog and pony show, such as the one I was a witness to at the Starbucks inside Safeway at 7th st. And McDowell yesterday. I like to think that I'm a pretty fair reviewer and it take's alot for me to give a \""scathing\"" review. \nHowever, in this case, it was well deserved. I was hoping to walk in and find a place to sit down, buy a coffee, and work on a project I planned on finishing. \nWhat I walked into shocked me... And I don't shock easily people. Trust me. \nFirst thing's first, The \""barista\"" working the kiosk, was standing out front of the kiosk, you know, where customers stand to order. Chatting it up and belligerantly cracking jokes really loud with the bagger/carryout boy and completely ignoring me. So much so, I sat down ( first having to brush the cracker crumbs and wrappers off my seat) choosing not to even buy a coffee!\nAssuming  they'd mastered time travel, suddenly we were all rocketed back to middle school! And the bag boy began teasing and chasing the girl \""barista\"" (If you could call her that) around in the small space allotted for Starbucks customers. \n Listen people, I am the furthest thing from a stick in the mud. And I'll be the first to say kid's should be kid's. But this was ridiculous. Yet more then anything else, it was down right unprofessional. When I pay hard earned cash for a service, I expect that service. Do your job people. Keep the place clean. Then you can mess around all you want. Basically, They crossed the line between high school hijinks, into, \n\""O.k. now your just making your company look bad. The floors were atrocious. Filthy even, With trash under the tables. As if things couldn't get any worse, it smelled. Bad. Like expired ham. That, was definitely a first for me. Never had a Starbucks smelled. Let alone that bad. And last, but certainly not least, they had no outlet's.  I get you want to turn a profit. Well fine, charge for it. Don't just, not provide them. Most people want to be able to charge their electronics while they enjoy their coffee. Come on Starbucks this is a \""no-brainer\""!\n O.k. kids, I realize you know everything... \nAnd what could a 30 year old.  Such as myself possibly  have to teach any of you millennial's that you don't already know?  (Just kidding)\nBut I did work at Safeway for a year and four months when I was a teenager. All I'm saying is that there's a time and a place for everything.  At work while a customer is staring at you, waiting to be served is not the time, nor the place.\nNothing and no place will ever be perfect. I don't expect anything to be. I do, however, expect \""said place\"" to, if they have some glaring flaws,  make up for it somewhere along the line...\nBut with this Starbucks location,  I was sorely disappointed."	0
995	"By the way, this restaurant is still open. Now it's called Field Kitchen, and if you liked the original Sweet Tomatoes concept, you are going to hate this. Gone is the \""all you can eat\"" concept. Now you go through the salad bar line, ONCE, they give you the dressing (you don't fill up yourself), and you get ONE bowl of soup. There's still all the bread you want but everything else is extra. They have added a beer/wine/specialty drink bar, lots of additional sides and the four special salads they used to have at the beginning of the salad bar has been replaced with several salads that are very expensive.\n\nWe were in the Tempe restaurant today at noon when it should have been packed. There were eight tables...my husband counted them and no one was going for all the specialty items which cost more. Also gone are the desserts...now they are extra. The only thing you can have your fill of is yogurt.\n\nWe went to this restaurant specifically today because I had an adjustment to my braces and the only thing I can comfortably eat is soup. I paid $10 for one bowl of soup.\n\nAt this rate, this place really will close and that will just be a darned shame."	1
996	Just popped in here as some of our friends who joined us after work hadn't eaten so for them pizza, for us a glass of wine and beer.	2
997	Are you kidding me?!?!?!?\n$610 after takes for 4 tires priced at $105/each! $180 in installation and taxes???? And to top it off the whole buy 3 get the 4th free is a lie, its free after a 6-8 week rebate!!!! and not in cash but by VISA card only!\n\nGo to Fletchers, 4 tires (BFG's) for $450 OTD, with 4 free oil changes....could it have been any better?	0
998	"Legit Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas? Check! \n\nThey only serve small size dishes here. So you order a lot and share.\n\nTuna Sashimi Tofu Salad: I dont usually eat sashimi because I can't get passed the texture. But I decided to try it here. And it was soooo goooddd. Maybe cause it was chopped up. Maybe cause it was sooo freshh. Either way, I was thinking..\"" Where has this been all my life!!??\"" Favorite dish of the day.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=NTV1hC0Dt5ObQon9fBg9FA#j3Vy1CPwzDo_5UWFrnkKQg\n\nSpider Roll: Portions was kinda small for a spider roll. Usually the spider rolls I get come with huge pieces of tempura and tons of crab. This one not that much. Still good though.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichiza-las-vegas?select=NTV1hC0Dt5ObQon9fBg9FA#AYwXJydKeIN5du8Vs7WJDQ\n\nTempura: Not greasy at all! Definite plus.

But the food is definitely fresh because you get to see all the chefs make the food for you in the kitchen."	3
999	Really an amazing technological production - the stage is amazing, the acts here are so creative.  You cannot go wrong with Mystere or O in Las Vegas - these are the top of the top shows in Vegas.  The standby line in the Bellagio never fails to produce tickets to those who are patient, even for those nights that they claim they are sold out.	4
